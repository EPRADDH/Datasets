As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Cell Site Gateway Malfunction;The local cell site gateway (e.g.; a router or L2 switch at the site) is not functioning properly; It could be due to a firmware crash; high CPU or a power issue; The gateway may be blocking traffic or not forwarding packets from the gNB,Attempt to access the gateway remotely (via OAM or SSH) to assess its status; If unreachable; the device may be crashed - power-cycle the gateway if remote power switch is available; If accessible but malfunctioning; check CPU/memory usage and logs for errors (e.g.; spanning tree; routing; etc.); Restart the gateway's network service or the entire unit to restore normal function; If the gateway continues to malfunction; plan to replace the unit; After restoring the gateway; verify that the gNB's traffic is once again reaching the core network properly
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,QoS Misclassification in Transport (Dropped Packets);Packets from gNB (either control or user plane) are not marked with correct QoS; leading to being dropped or de-prioritized in the network; A policy in the transport network might be misidentifying gNB traffic; Improper DSCP marking or VLAN priority set on gNB or at network edge,Analyze the DSCP or 802.1p markings on outgoing gNB traffic (if possible via packet capture or OAM stats) and compare with expected values; Consult with the transport network team to understand what QoS markings are expected for guaranteed delivery (especially for control plane); Reconfigure the gNB traffic classification settings to mark packets correctly as per provider requirements; Alternatively; adjust the transport network policy to recognize the gNB's current markings; After adjustments; test the control plane messages and data traffic to ensure they are no longer being dropped
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Backhaul Bandwidth Exhausted (Overutilization);The data throughput demand has reached the maximum capacity of the backhaul link; No headroom left for bursts leading to buffering and dropped packets; Possibly an abnormal traffic surge or misrouted traffic taking up capacity,Confirm the bandwidth utilization via NMS or interface statistics; checking if its consistently at 100%; Check for any unusual traffic patterns (maybe a single UE or IP using excessive bandwidth) and if possible apply rate limiting or shape that traffic via core network policies; Liaise with the transport provider to see if a temporary bandwidth boost is possible (some support burst above CIR if QoS allows); In the long run; plan for capacity upgrade or add a secondary link to the site; Short term; ensure essential traffic (control; VoIP) is prioritized with QoS to maintain those services under full load; Monitor if the utilization reduces during off-peak to confirm it's truly traffic demand and not a stuck loop
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Network Loop Detected (Broadcast Storm on Backhaul);A networking loop at the site or upstream is causing broadcast/multicast storms; overwhelming the backhaul; Possibly an improper cabling (connecting two ports together) or spanning-tree failure; Could also be a misconfigured redundancy causing duplication of packets,Verify spanning tree (STP/RSTP) status on the site switch and look for topology change notifications or blocked ports; Identify if any recent changes were made to cabling or VLAN configs that could introduce a loop; If a loop is suspected at the site; systematically disconnect one suspect connection at a time to break the loop (especially any suspicious jumpers or secondary connections); Once loop is broken; traffic storm should subside; Ensure STP is enabled on all switches and that redundant links have one port in blocking state; If the loop was upstream; coordinate with the network team to address it at the source; Confirm normal traffic levels and switch CPU usage after resolution
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,MTU Mismatch Causing Packet Drops;The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) setting on the gNB and transport network are inconsistent; PMTU discovery might be disabled or ICMP blocked; causing black hole for large packets; Fragmentation not happening where it should due to misconfig,Determine the MTU configured on the gNB interface and the expected MTU of the transport network; If gNB sends larger packets than allowed by an intermediate link that drops fragments (common if ICMP is blocked); those packets get dropped; Align MTU by setting the gNB MTU to a safe value (e.g.; 1500 bytes) if currently higher; or configure the transport network to support the larger MTU if needed (enable jumbo frames end-to-end); Ensure that path MTU discovery is allowed (ICMP need-to-fragment messages are not filtered) for future dynamic adjustment; After adjusting; test by sending max size packets and confirm none are dropped
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Upstream Network Maintenance (Temporary Outage);Known or unknown maintenance activity by the upstream provider or core network causing a brief outage; Could be software upgrade on an aggregator router or link failover testing; Planned work outside of scheduled window or not communicated,Contact the network provider or core network team to confirm if maintenance is/was in progress; Correlate the time of outage with any advisory or notification of planned work; If maintenance; usually no action is needed except to monitor and confirm service returns after the window; If unplanned; treat it like an outage: ensure the gNB reconnects automatically when network is back; If the maintenance caused issues (like configuration changes); verify all settings (e.g.; routing; VLAN) remain correct post-work; Document the event and consider working with provider for better communication or redundancy to avoid total outage during maintenance
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Dual Homed Backhaul - Both Links Down;Primary and secondary backhaul links to site are both unavailable; Possibly a fiber cut in a common duct affecting both; or power failure at an aggregation point; Could be independent failures coincident in time (rare but possible),Immediately escalate to the transport provider; indicating that both diverse paths are down (highest priority restoration); Utilize any tertiary backup if available (like cellular modem or temporary link) to get minimal connectivity; Check site power and local equipment first to ensure it's not a site issue (like site router down causing both links to appear down); Provide support for path diversity troubleshooting (maybe coordinate different teams if two providers); Once one of the links is restored; verify gNB connectivity and unload data first; Investigate why dual redundancy failed - if they share a common point; plan truly diverse routes in future; After restoration; perform tests on both links individually to ensure full resiliency
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,ARP Resolution Failure on Transport Network;gNB cannot resolve the MAC address of the next-hop gateway due to missing ARP reply; Possibly ARP requests not leaving the gNB or being blocked; Duplicate IP causing incorrect ARP responses; ARP table overflow or stale entry in gNB or router,Check the gNB's ARP table (if accessible via OAM) to see if the gateway's MAC is known; Use ping from gNB to gateway to trigger ARP and watch if an ARP request is seen on the link (may require a packet capture); Ensure that the VLAN tagging is correct so that ARP requests reach the correct broadcast domain; If a duplicate IP issue; resolve the conflict so the correct device responds; Clear ARP cache on gNB and site router to force fresh resolution; On router; check for any security (like dynamic ARP inspection) that might be blocking the gNB; Once ARP entries are correctly established and stable; test connectivity by continuous ping
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Primary Backhaul Down - Site on Low-Capacity Backup;The main high-speed link down; now using a slower backup (e.g.; LTE backup or narrowband connection) leading to limited throughput; The backup link might be a temporary wireless or DSL link with limited capacity; Primary link outage due to fiber cut or equipment failure,Confirm the failover: check that the gNB is indeed connected via the backup link and the primary link shows down; Immediately notify transport provider about primary link failure for urgent repair; Manage traffic during backup usage: implement traffic shaping to prevent saturating the backup (prioritize signaling and services; possibly limit heavy throughput); Keep monitoring the backup link quality as it may be less stable under load; Once the primary link is repaired and comes up; verify that traffic switches back automatically or perform manual switchback if needed; After restoration; evaluate the failover performance and consider enhancements if the backup struggled with load
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Route Flap in Network Causing Instability;Frequent changes in network routing (possibly due to an unstable link or misconfigured routing protocol) causing intermittent connectivity; BGP or OSPF neighbor flapping leading to route withdraw and re-add cycles; Possibly a marginal link oscillating between up/down states,Work with the network team to identify the flapping route or neighbor (check logs on site router for BGP/OSPF events); Once identified; isolate the cause: if a link is unstable; focus on fixing that link (or administratively shut it until stable); If a routing config; perhaps implement route dampening or fix the misconfig causing oscillation; As a stop-gap; a static route could be applied for the gNB's networks to stabilize connectivity until dynamic routing is stable; but coordinate with network team to avoid loops; After resolving the underlying cause (link fixed or config corrected); monitor the route table over time to ensure it stays consistent and the gNB remains reachable without interruption
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Packet Fragmentation Issue;Large packets being fragmented; might be dropping fragments if not handled; Maybe path MTU discovery issues causing black-hole for large packets; Possibly path MTU discovery is disabled and intermediate link with smaller MTU is dropping fragments or not fragmenting due to DF flag,Detect if fragmentation is the cause by attempting to send various sized pings with DF flag to see where it fails; If fragmentation is needed but not happening; ensure intermediate devices allow ICMP Fragmentation Needed messages so source can reduce packet size; Alternatively; adjust the gNB's MTU to a smaller value (e.g.; 1400 bytes) to avoid fragmentation entirely for now; Check that no firewall is dropping fragmented packets or related ICMP signals; Once adjustments are made; test by sending a large data file through the gNB and see if it goes through; Long term; configure path MTU properly and educate any firewall to permit necessary ICMP; Keep the gNB at a standard MTU unless the network end-to-end supports jumbo frames reliably
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Fronthaul Jitter/Delay Excessive (Timing Risk);The delay or jitter on the fronthaul (between DU and RUs or between radio units) is exceeding thresholds; potentially affecting coordination (especially in TDD or sync requirements); Possibly due to a congested fronthaul switch or long cascaded fronthaul network; In a packet-based fronthaul; insufficient QoS for timing traffic,Measure the current fronthaul latency and jitter via OAM if possible (some systems provide these stats) or by test; If using eCPRI over Ethernet; ensure the fronthaul switch is giving priority to that traffic class and not introducing variable delay; Check for any network load on fronthaul (like other services) that could be saturating it; and separate or limit them; If the topology has multiple hops; consider simplifying or upgrading it (e.g.; direct fiber vs going through many switches); In immediate terms; if jitter is causing desync; you might reduce the number of carriers or coordination features (like turn off advanced CA or MIMO modes requiring tight sync) to lighten requirements until fix; After network adjustments; monitor jitter values to confirm they are back within spec and no more timing alarms
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Baseband CPU 100% Utilization;The gNB's baseband processing unit is maxed out on CPU resources; Possibly due to too many active users or complex features (e.g.; very high MIMO layers; Carrier Aggregation) running simultaneously; It could also indicate an inefficiency or overload beyond design capacity,Check the number of connected users and active bearers against planned capacity   if it's over the normal range; consider offloading some traffic (e.g.; enable load balancing to other cells or reduce coverage slightly to push edge users elsewhere); If within expected load; then high CPU might mean a configuration issue (like an algorithm running too often)   try disabling or scaling back optional features such as extensive logging or features that consume CPU; Ensure the gNB is using the latest optimized software; as vendors often improve CPU usage in later releases; If hardware supports it; consider adding another baseband board or upgrading to a higher capacity unit; In the short term; you could reboot the node to clear any runaway processes (if it's a transient issue); Long term; plan for capacity expansion (more hardware or more cells) if user demand consistently peaks CPU; Monitor after any change to see CPU drops below 100% with some headroom
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Memory Exhaustion on gNB;The gNB is running out of RAM; which could be due to very high load (lots of UEs; large buffers for traffic) or a possible memory leak. As memory fills up; the system may start rejecting new sessions or experience crashes. High paging; large number of small packet flows; or extensive logging can also contribute,Access the gNB's memory usage stats via OAM and identify which subsystems are consuming most of it (some systems allow breakdown by task); If it's a leak; you'll see memory usage only ever rising   in that case; a software patch is needed; so involve the vendor; If it's due to legitimate load (lots of UEs or data); consider the memory capacity of your hardware: upgrading to a variant with more memory or adding memory (if possible) might be required; In the immediate term; you could reduce load   e.g.; temporarily cap the number of connected users through admission control; or reduce maximum bearers per UE if that's an option; to relieve memory usage; Clear out any unnecessary logs or large trace buffers that might be held in memory; Perform a controlled restart during low traffic to free memory (this is a band-aid but prevents a crash at peak time); After that; continuously monitor   if it creeps up again; plan a maintenance window to implement the longer-term fixes (software update or capacity expansion); Confirm after fixes that memory stays within safe limits even at high load
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,RRU Processor Overload;The remote radio unit's internal CPU/DSP is overwhelmed. This might happen if the RRU is tasked with more than it can handle   for example; too many active antenna beams or a very high sample rate with multiple carriers. It could also be due to high UL interference forcing the RRU to do extra work (e.g.; many retries; heavy filtering),Check if the RRU is handling multiple bands or carriers and if it is within its spec for number of TX/RX channels active; If multiple carriers are configured; consider temporarily turning one off to relieve processing load and see if overload alarm clears; Ensure the RRU firmware is updated   vendors optimize RRU processing in firmware updates sometimes; Assess the environment for interference   if the RRU is constantly in heavy interference mitigation; address that (like find and reduce interference sources) to reduce RRU processing strain; If the site recently had new config (like more MIMO layers); maybe revert that to see if RRU load drops; Long run; if capacity needs demand these configs; you might need a newer RRU model with higher processing capability; After any change; monitor the RRU status via OAM to ensure the processor usage falls back to normal range; Also ensure the RRU isn't overheating; as that can sometimes cause performance to throttle   if overheating; improve cooling or shade for the unit
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Max Connected UEs Exceeded;The number of UEs attempting to connect to this gNB cell exceeds its configured or licensed capacity. This could happen during special events or if neighboring cells went down and all users camp here. When the max is exceeded; new UEs get blocked or dropped,Verify from OAM the current connected UE count and the maximum supported (license or config limit). If indeed at max; you'll likely see connection reject messages at the core or in gNB logs with cause 'load'; If this is a one-time surge (like event); consider deploying a temporary cell (COLT) or ask users to switch to other technologies if possible for relief; If this is becoming regular; you need to plan capacity: either increase the license for more UEs if the hardware can support it; or split the cell (add another cell/sector) to distribute load; or add small cells in the area; In the short term; ensure features like admission control are tuned: e.g.; perhaps prioritize new connection for certain services (emergency) and bar lowest priority when at capacity; Check if all those connections are active   sometimes ghost UEs hold slots (if a bug left contexts around; fixing that could free slots); After any immediate mitigation; coordinate with planning to address the root cause by increasing network capacity; Monitor the UE count and drop rate to see if situation improves after actions
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Signaling Storm / RRC Connection Surge;A massive number of UEs are attempting to connect or reconnect in a short time; overwhelming the RRC connection handling. This can occur after a network outage (all UEs try to reconnect) or due to some malfunction causing UEs to constantly reattach. It could also be a malicious attack simulating many connection attempts. The RAN can only handle so many RRC setups per second; leading to failures,Determine the cause of the surge: if it's after an outage; it's somewhat expected   in future; implement staggered reattach or RRC throttling (some networks have random access barring after an outage to spread the load); If it's ongoing (like a misbehaving UE or network element causing repeated connects); try to identify if a particular UE or group is constantly reconnecting   often core signaling can point to IMSIs with many attempts. If found; you might consider temporarily blocking that UE or fixing its issue (maybe a faulty SIM or device); Ensure Access Class Barring is configured for overload scenarios   e.g.; allow only certain access classes when RRC connections > threshold; to protect network for priority services; The gNB may have an overload indicator to core   verify it's functioning to maybe slow down paging for UEs; If it's an attack (many bogus requests); coordinate with security to possibly filter at network edge; After immediate measures; once storm passes or is controlled; the RRC success rate should return to normal; Debrief and enhance procedures: e.g.; if a power outage triggered it; perhaps power on base stations gradually or have UEs on random backoff; Document and prepare for future events with better RAN overload settings
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Throughput Capacity Maxed Out;The cell is fully utilizing its available throughput capacity (all PRBs used in downlink and/or uplink) given current bandwidth and MIMO layers. Essentially; user demand has reached the physical limit of what the cell can carry. Users will experience limited speeds and high usage indicators will show on OAM,Review performance counters for PRB (Physical Resource Block) utilization   likely at ~100% during busy hours; If you have additional spectrum or carrier that is not being used; consider activating it or carrier aggregating it to increase capacity; If already at max configuration; offload traffic: this could be via enabling handovers to other technologies (like ensure 4G anchor is carrying some load in NSA; or encourage WiFi use if applicable); or deploy another cell/sector; Also check if the throughput is maxed out due to a few heavy users   perhaps implement traffic shaping for fairness (ensure no single user is hogging everything; although on RAN usually scheduler handles this fairly); Consider adding massive MIMO or spatial multiplexing if not already   while it doesn't add spectrum; it reuses it spatially to boost capacity if hardware supports and if environment allows multi-user MIMO; Short term; communicate to network operations that the cell is at capacity   they might redirect new customer acquisitions to other bands or areas to avoid further strain; After adding capacity; monitor to see PRB usage drops below 100% except peak bursts; The aim is to keep it maybe under ~80-90% to allow headroom for spikes
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Downlink PRB Utilization 100%;All available downlink radio resources (PRBs) in the cell are continuously in use. This indicates that user demand for downlink data is at the maximum the cell can deliver on its current bandwidth. Could be many users streaming or a few users with very high throughput needs. If persistent; it's a capacity issue,Similar to throughput max   confirm via statistics that DL PRB utilization is indeed 100% for significant periods; Ensure that the scheduler is working fairly   if one UE with a good channel is taking most resources; maybe implement fairness or check if any QoS is skewing (like a test UE with unlimited priority); If it's uniformly high due to many users; consider adding a second carrier or frequency band if available to split load (e.g.; if only n78 5G was deployed; maybe also use n1 or others if network has them; or rely on LTE anchor to offload less demanding flows via ENDC); Another approach: if some traffic is not latency sensitive; one could intentionally throttle it via core network policies (like rate-limit video streaming traffic a bit) to free some PRBs for others   this is an operator strategy decision; In dense urban; small cells could be deployed to share traffic in hotspot areas; In the moment; there's not much to do except possibly invoke an admission control for new heavy sessions (i.e.; new large downloads might have to wait) but this is advanced; Long term fix is capacity: more spectrum; more sites; or more efficient tech (like upgrade to next release that might have better spectral efficiency; though gains are limited); After any improvements; measure PRB usage again to ensure it isn't constantly saturated; The user experience (throughput per user) should improve
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Uplink Interference Causing Retransmission Overload;Significant interference in the uplink (could be external source or a noisy UE) is causing many uplink packets to be lost or corrupted; leading to frequent retransmissions (HARQ retries). This extra load on the RAN (processing the same data multiple times) can tie up resources and reduce capacity for actual new data,Inspect uplink quality indicators: high UL BLER (block error rate) or a lot of NACKs in HARQ stats point to interference or noise; Use spectrum analysis tools if available to identify if an external interference source is present (like illegal repeater; or equipment emitting in band); If it's a single UE causing it (like a malfunctioning device transmitting garbage); try to isolate by triangulation or checking if interference ceases when certain UEs disconnect; Once identified; remove or fix the interference source: e.g.; work with regulatory body if it's external; in meantime; possibly narrow the UL bandwidth usage if interference is only on part (skip problematic frequencies); though that reduces capacity; Alternatively; increase power of UEs (power control) to overcome interference; but that only works if interference is not too high and will cause more noise to neighbors; For immediate relief; consider shifting some uplink-heavy users to another cell if possible; After mitigation; check HARQ stats   they should show fewer retransmissions; and uplink throughput per user should increase; The gNB CPU usage might also drop if it was high due to handling so many retries
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,RRC Connection Table Full;The gNB has a finite table or pool for active RRC connections (UE contexts); and all entries are in use. This could be due to high number of connected UEs or possibly some stale entries occupying space. New connection attempts will be rejected because there's no free slot in the connection table,Correlate with 'Max Connected UEs Exceeded' since it's similar   check how many connections vs capacity; If near capacity; actions from above apply (offload; increase capacity; etc.); If the number isn't supposed to be that high; suspect stale contexts   maybe the table didn't clear some disconnected UEs (a bug). In that case; a restart would free them as a short term fix; but pushing vendor to fix the release of contexts is needed; As a quick approach; you might reduce the inactivity timer so that idle UEs get dropped sooner; freeing their context for new active ones (at expense of them reconnecting later; but better than blocking new ones entirely); Also ensure any abnormal events like handover failures are cleaned (like if a UE moves out without proper release; maybe use a context release timer on core to eventually tell RAN to free it); Once immediate user access is restored by freeing some entries (maybe by kicking some idle ones or a reboot); prioritize either license increase or system expansion to handle more UEs if legitimate load; After fix; monitor the connection count and ensure it stays below threshold or that threshold is raised; Also; set up alarms to get early warning (like at 80% full) so you can act before it's completely full next time
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,GTP Tunnel Allocation Exhausted;The gNB (or its user plane component) has a limit on number of GTP-U tunnels it can maintain (each PDU session has typically one downlink tunnel). If a lot of users and multiple QoS flows per user are active; the total tunnel count might hit a platform limit. At that point; new data sessions can't be established,Check the number of active PDU sessions or bearers and see if it aligns with a known limit (some gNB might support; say; 2048 GTP tunnels; which could be e.g. 1024 users with 2 flows each); If hitting a known limit and usage demands exceed it; consider increasing license (if it's a licensed limit) or upgrading to a higher capacity CU (Central Unit) that handles more tunnels; If not an option short-term; you might restrict each UE to fewer QoS flows by policy (like do not allow every app to create separate QoS flows if not necessary)   this could be done via core network policy to avoid hitting tunnel limit per UE; If some tunnels are stale (maybe from UEs that disconnected improperly); clean them up from core side   core should remove them; but if gNB didn't; a restart of user-plane function at gNB could clear those (though that drops everyone); Engage vendor if the limit was unexpected   maybe a config exists to increase it if memory allows; Once mitigated; new sessions should establish normally (monitor successful PDU session establishment rate); In long term; ensure capacity planning accounts for the number of QoS flows and not just users (maybe encourage use of default bearer only unless QoS is needed); After fix or scale-up; test by gradually adding load to see that the limit is no longer reached
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Neighbor List Table Full;The gNB has a maximum number of neighbor cell entries it can store (for measurements/handover). If the network defined a very large number of neighbors (perhaps in a dense network or misconfigured with far neighbors); it might exceed that. Alternatively; an automatic neighbor relation function might be adding too many neighbors dynamically until table is full; potentially causing new neighbor additions to fail or be ignored,Review how many neighbors are configured versus how many are really needed. Perhaps some pruning can be done: remove neighbors that are rarely if ever used (check handover attempt stats to those neighbors); If using automatic neighbor addition; set a cap or refine criteria so it doesn keep every little cell it ever sees; Check vendor documentation for neighbor list limit   ensure planned neighbors stay under that; If needed; increase the table size via config if the platform allows (some systems have a tunable for neighbor list length; within some upper bound); In immediate terms; the impact is mainly on mobility   if table is full; new neighbors won't be added; possibly leading to some HO failures if a needed neighbor is missing. So make sure neighbors are already in the list (manually add if auto is failing now); After cleanup or adjustments; verify that new neighbors can be added (no more errors about table full in logs); Also mobility KPIs   ensure handover success especially to any newly added neighbors works; Keep the neighbor list tidy going forward   implement periodic audit to remove obsolete entries
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Bearer Limit Reached;The gNB cannot establish new radio bearers because it has reached the maximum number of bearers it can support (bearers = flows per UE; aggregated over all UEs). Each UE can have multiple bearers (QoS flows). A combination of many UEs and each with multiple bearers can hit this limit. It might be slightly different from just number of UEs or tunnels because one UE might have multiple bearers (like separate QoS for voice; video; etc.),This is akin to the GTP tunnel limit   confirm how many bearers are active (the sum of data and signaling bearers across all UEs) and what's the supported maximum. For instance; maybe system supports 4096 bearers and you're at that; If the system allows prioritizing certain bearer establishments; ensure ones (like the default bearers for new UE) can get through by perhaps limiting secondary bearers for QoS if at limit; You might instruct core network temporarily to not assign secondary QoS flows on this cell unless needed (like don't use GBR bearers for video in this cell if it's congested; using policy control); Another approach: if some users have more than one PDU session (like separate for internet and for slicing); consider if both are needed; Check license   sometimes an upgrade (license or software) can bump the supported bearer count; Clearing stale or inactive bearers: maybe some bearers stuck if UE left   ensure core triggers release; A short-term brute force is to trigger reattach for some UEs (which drops their bearers and re-establish minimal ones) but that's disruptive; After remedy; the bearer establishment success rate should improve; and new services (like VoNR call which needs a dedicated bearer) should succeed; Track how close to limit it runs and plan expansion if frequently near cap
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Scheduler Overload (Too many active flows);The MAC scheduler has too many concurrent flows/users to schedule efficiently each TTI. It might start lagging or not giving timely grants; leading to suboptimal throughput or increased latency. Essentially; the number of active data flows exceeds what the scheduling algorithm (or CPU) can handle in real-time; especially if it tries to do complex calculations for each,If CPU is spiking at scheduling (which we saw in CPU 100% scenario); that's part of this   but even without CPU 100%; algorithmic overload might happen. Look at how many users are active simultaneously (with data in buffer). If extremely high; consider implementing a form of admission control at data level: e.g.; limit how many can be scheduled truly simultaneously by maybe not scheduling some lower priority flows every single TTI (some schedulers allow config like schedule max N users per TTI to avoid overload; albeit at cost of some throughput); If the vendor has an 'enhanced scheduler' option or multi-threading for scheduling; enabling that could help if platform supports; Possibly reduce the frequency of certain scheduler-intensive features (like if every TTI the scheduler recalculates MIMO precoding for dozens of users; that's heavy   maybe reduce the adaptation rate slightly); Offloading some users to another carrier or frequency if possible means fewer per scheduler; After changes; measure if average scheduling time per TTI reduces (hard to measure directly; but improved throughput or consistent latency implies success); Keep active user count per cell under a threshold through network design (split cell if regularly seeing too many at once); And ask vendor for any known limits or tuning parameters for the scheduler when user count is high
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Downlink Buffer Overflow;The gNB's downlink buffer for one or more UEs overflowed; meaning it received more data from the core than it could transmit over the air in time. This results in packet drops in the downlink buffer. Possibly caused by a mismatch in flow control   the core keeps sending data even though the cell is congested (could be because slicing or QoS not configured to signal backpressure); or simply because of a sudden burst that exceeds buffering,Enable or check flow control mechanisms: e.g.; many gNBs use GTP-U congestion feedback (like sending an overload indication or slowing down GTP). Ensure this is configured and working with the core (UPF) so that when RAN buffers fill
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Uplink Buffer Overflow;In the uplink; the gNB might have buffers (in RLC or PDCP) for data coming from multiple UEs before forwarding to core. If uplink data arrives faster than can be forwarded (perhaps due to backhaul limitation or core processing); those buffers can overflow; causing uplink packet drops. Alternatively; if UEs send a lot at once and scheduling can't serve them timely; similar overflow can happen at UE side (but that would be in UE buffers more). Likely scenario: backhaul slower than radio; or core slow to receive,Check if backhaul throughput is at capacity when this happens   if yes; then essentially the UEs can send more than backhaul can carry. Solution: upgrade backhaul or shape uplink traffic. Possibly enforce a rate limit on UE uplink at gNB (some gNB have feature to not schedule more than X Mbps total if backhaul limited); If backhaul is fine; could be core not reading fast enough (less likely; but maybe if many sites feed one aggregator); Ensure the gNB sends any flow control towards UEs   e.g.; there's no explicit flow control in uplink besides not scheduling; so if gNB scheduler can't schedule in time; UEs should backoff based on no grants (so maybe it accumulates at UE side rather than gNB? Actually; RLC AM mode can accumulate in gNB if core slow   the gNB receives PDUs from UE and holds them until forwarded. If core slow; those stay in gNB buffer until delivered or dropped); Possibly tune the PDCP discard timer for uplink: if data sits too long (meaning core couldn't take it); better to drop earlier to avoid buffer fill; Work with core team to see if any pacing needed on uplink acknowledge (not common though); After any changes; monitor uplink loss   the app level (like TCP) would show if improvements; If the issue was backhaul; you'll see improvement by matching radio send rate to backhaul capacity (no more large queue build-up); Also monitor any gNB logs about UL buffer occupancy to see if they remain below after fix
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,HARQ Process Exhaustion;Each UE typically has a limited number of HARQ (Hybrid ARQ) processes for uplink and downlink. If the network conditions cause constant retransmissions and none of the processes can be closed (waiting for ACKs); eventually all HARQ processes can be in use; meaning new transmissions have to wait (which reduces throughput) or get dropped. This could happen e.g.; if ACK/NACK signaling is failing or if interference keeps every packet in a loop of tries,Identify if HARQ processes are frequently all full   the gNB might have a counter or log for HARQ failures. Also UEs might report 'HARQ failures' as a cause of radio link failure; Improve the radio conditions: if interference or poor coverage is causing many NACKs; fix that (optimize power; coverage; interference mitigation). The fewer NACKs; the faster HARQ processes free up; If it's downlink HARQ stuck (maybe UE isn't sending ACKs due to uplink control problem?); check PUCCH reliability   perhaps power up PUCCH or adjust format to ensure ACKs are heard; If an uplink HARQ issue; ensure gNB is sending ACKs properly   might tie into a software bug as earlier sections or just heavy interference on downlink control; No direct way to 'increase number of HARQ processes' as it's standard (16 typically); so solution always is reduce how often they all get tied up by improving link or reducing load per UE; If one UE seems to hog HARQ (like a poor signal UE keeps all processes busy); consider dropping that UE earlier (like hand it over to another cell or force it to lower MCS to reduce re-tx); After addressing cause (like interference reduction or power adjustments); check HARQ stats again   ideally the utilization of processes should be moderate; with low failure count; The overall throughput should also increase as fewer rounds are needed
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,License Capacity Exceeded (UE or Throughput);The gNB has a license-imposed cap on either the number of users or the aggregate throughput it can support. If the network demand tries to exceed that; the system will enforce it (dropping additional UEs or throttling throughput). This might not present as a hardware resource issue; but the OAM will show license limit alarms or counters hitting 100% licensed capacity,Check the license status on OAM   look for any counters of license usage (like 'UE count license usage 100%' or throughput license); If confirmed; the straightforward solution is to obtain a higher license from the vendor. This might be a software key or upgrade purchase; Meanwhile; treat it like a real capacity issue: try to keep usage below cap by offloading or controlling traffic as discussed in earlier points (like offload some UEs; etc.); but that only helps if you have somewhere else to put them; Prioritize connections if possible (maybe the system automatically only allows up to X UEs; so beyond that they can't attach   if thats the case; ensure important UEs like emergency have higher chance by using access class features); Escalate within your organization because license issues often involve commercial decision to upgrade license; Once the license is expanded and applied (a relatively quick process if procurement done   just load a new key); verify on OAM that the limit increased (like now shows capacity for more UEs) and the alarm clears; Then monitor usage   if you regularly again hitting near new license limit; perhaps plan even further expansion or check if something is artificially consuming many resources (like ghost UEs or misconfigs); Keep track of usage vs license to preempt future exhaustion
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Control Plane CPU Overload;The CPU or processing resources dedicated to control plane tasks (RRC; signaling; scheduling control messages etc.) are maxed out. This often happens if there are too many control events: high mobility (lots of handovers); many RRC connects/disconnects; or very frequent scheduling decisions beyond capacity. It could cause slow response to RRC messages or even drop some; leading to signaling failures,Assess control plane load via KPIs: e.g.; RRC setup attempt rate; Handover attempt rate; paging rate; etc. Are they very high? If yes; and if some are unnecessary (like too frequent periodic updates); consider tuning those down. For example; if UEs are handing over too often (ping-pong); adjust thresholds to reduce that churn. If a lot of UEs connect/disconnect (maybe IoT devices waking up); could implement access class barring for non-ones to smooth the spikes. Ensure the gNB is not doing excessive measurement reporting   maybe reduce how often or how many measurements are configured (that generates control plane load to process each report). Another angle: check if any misbehaving device is flooding the control plane (like a UE sending too many requests)   rare but possible; address if found. Short term; if overloaded; the system might already be dropping some signaling   monitor RRC success and paging success. Use any built-in overload mitigation features: some systems when CPU high will start rejecting low-pri requests to save itself   ensure those triggers are on. Long term; if area needs it; splitting the cell or adding another site reduces number of UEs per site; thus control load. After interventions; measure control plane CPU if visible; or indirectly by improved RRC setup times and lower drop rate of signaling. The gNB logs might also stop showing warnings about scheduling delay or similar
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Paging Capacity Exhausted;There are more idle UEs in the tracking area (or specifically camping on this cell) than the paging channel configuration can handle; resulting in some pages being dropped or delayed. In 5G; if a cell has a very large TA list or too many UEs; the scheduled paging occasions might not be enough. Or if the network tries to page too many at once (like for a group call or during mass event); it exceeds paging channel capacity,Look at paging performance counters: if paging discard count is high or success rate low; and this cell often has full paging occasions; that's evidence. One solution is to reduce the number of UEs that need to be paged simultaneously on this cell: shrink the tracking area size so that pages are spread across more cells (i.e.; not all idle UEs are in one TA covering this cell). Though this involves core network configuration as well. Another is to increase paging capacity: if currently using default paging cycle and number of paging blocks; maybe allocate more (some networks allow increasing how many paging messages per frame at cost of slight throughput or overhead). If this is during a short-term event (concert etc.); a temporary TA change or smaller area could help (like create a special TA for that event site only; so fewer idle in each TA). For group/mass paging (like emergency alert to all); ensure the system can do extended paging or use cell broadcast instead; which is more efficient than individual paging. After changes; track paging success   it should go up; and UEs should get their downlink data or calls reliably. If network supports it; also use 5G's extended paging mechanisms (like higher layer paging e.g.; via eDRX scheduling if IoT   not directly for smartphones though). If the cell still is overloaded with idle users; adding another cell (like split into two cells each with its own paging resources) effectively doubles capacity too
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Power Amplifier Saturation (At max power);The power amplifiers in the radio are at their maximum output; meaning the cell is transmitting at full power constantly. This can happen if many users are at the cell edge or if uplink interference triggers max downlink power to maintain links. It could also be misconfiguration with power. Running at saturation can cause distortion and isn't sustainable long-term (may trigger temp alarms),Confirm via OAM if the transmit power on each sector is hitting the configured max (some systems have counters for time at max power). Also; check if there's an unusual coverage hole making UEs sit at edge needing high power. If many UEs are at edge; consider optimizing coverage: maybe down-tilt a bit to shrink cell so fewer really weak connections; or add a site to offload distant users. Check if the power per PRB is set correctly   if someone accidentally set reference signals too high; might cause unnecessary high usage. If interference is a cause (e.g.; from neighboring cell on same freq; making gNB increase power to overcome); coordinate frequencies or reduce interference through tuning. Short term; there's not a direct throttle except maybe capping some services (but that doesn't directly reduce power usage if channel conditions remain bad for those connected). Also ensure no hardware issue: a failing antenna or cable could make node think it needs more power to compensate   examine VSWR or downlink VSWR if available. After improvements; you should see transmit power headroom   not flat max all the time. This can also improve quality because an amplifier at saturation can introduce non-linearity (so after fix; perhaps less downlink error rate). Monitor for any residual alarms or performance issues. If nothing helps because it's simply a heavily loaded wide cell; then it's capacity/coverage expansion time (new site or carrier) to reduce need for max blasting
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Spectrum Exhaustion (All resource blocks in use);The allocated spectrum for this cell is fully utilized and even with perfect scheduling; you cannot serve additional demand. This is essentially the same as throughput capacity maxed out   it's a more fundamental limit that without more spectrum; you can't increase capacity beyond this. It may also refer to if you needed to add carriers but none are free/available spectrum-wise,Coordinate with spectrum management and regulatory: If possible; refarm or obtain additional spectrum. For example; if some 4G band can be refarmed to 5G to give this cell more bandwidth; do so (ensuring 4G coverage remains acceptable through other means or technology shifts). Use techniques to use spectrum more efficiently: e.g.; ensure you're using highest order modulation and coding available (the gNB likely is; if conditions allow). Introduce massive MIMO if not already   while it doesn't add spectrum; it reuses it spatially to boost capacity. If the cell isn't already using carrier aggregation; consider deploying a second band to augment capacity. Implement advanced features like CoMP (coordinated multi-point) or offload some data to unlicensed spectrum (NR-U or LAA if supported) to effectively increase available spectrum. If at absolute limit and no new spectrum coming; manage demand: encourage WiFi offload for heavy usage apps (maybe deploy public WiFi in the area to shift traffic); or use policies to reduce extreme usage (like temporary video resolution downgrades in congestion). In the near term; there's not much to do but ensure fairness so all users at least get a share (the scheduler typically does that). After any improvement (like adding a carrier); measure total cell throughput   it should rise if more spectrum added or better usage if MIMO improved spatial multiplexing. Ultimately; highlight to planning that this cell is spectrally starved for how many users it has; so they consider smaller cells (splitting cell coverage) to reuse the same spectrum in smaller areas (since frequency reuse is the only way beyond adding new spectrum)
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SSB Beam Limit Reached;The gNB can only transmit a certain number of Synchronization Signal Block beams (e.g.; 8 or 64 depending on config). If trying to cover too wide an area or if configured to a certain max; beyond that UEs might not get initial sync signals in some directions. Alternatively; it might refer to trying to use more beams than hardware supports (maybe misconfig attempted 16 beams on 8-beam hardware),Verify how many SSB beams are configured vs supported. If someone increased it in config above hardware capability; reduce to supported number. If the issue is coverage (like 8 beams not enough to cover 360 degrees properly with enough gain); consider adding a second cell or adjusting antenna orientation. If applicable; you could switch to a wider beam SSB (some systems allow either narrower many beams or fewer wider beams for sync)   if initial access is more important than beamforming gain; maybe use fewer SSBs with wider beam to cover all directions at expense of initial RSRP maybe being lower but at least present. Another angle: in very tall buildings or wide sectors; ensure the SSB beams are tilted appropriately to cover ground   maybe some beams wasted up high or too low. If it's a hardware limit; to truly overcome you may need an upgrade to an antenna that supports more beams (like going from 8-beam to 64-beam panel). Document the limitation to front-line support so they know UEs at certain angles might not see SSB   they might increase cell reselection offsets to encourage those areas to use another cell if possible. After any reconfiguration; test UE in various locations around cell to ensure it can detect SSB. If previously there were reports of no signal in some area; confirm if resolved (if not; likely need another site or adjust tilt further). SSB beam issues are crucial for initial access   track RACH success around the cell to gauge improvement
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Too Many Handovers (Signaling Overload);Extremely frequent handovers (perhaps due to a cluster of small cells or poorly tuned thresholds) are causing a lot of signaling and possibly overwhelming the RAN and even core with location updates. If UEs ping-pong or handover every few seconds (like vehicles passing many small 5G cells); the overhead can eat into capacity and CPU. This can be seen as a RAN resource exhaustion in terms of processing signaling and maintaining contexts for many HOs,Review mobility logs: if you see same UEs handing over back and forth or moving through many cells quickly; identify if thresholds can be optimized: increase time-to-trigger for handover so brief good signal from neighbor doesn't immediately trigger; add hysteresis to avoid ping-pong; or if cells are too small for the speed (like a car crosses cell in seconds); maybe consider turning some cells to idle mode when not needed or rely on a macro layer for fast movers. Use features like conditional handover or dual connectivity if available: e.g.; in 5G; use multi-connectivity so that a fast-moving UE keeps connection to macro while using small cell; reducing hard handovers count. If signaling is the main concern; possibly restrict how many handovers per minute a single UE can do (some networks have implicit clamp; but not standard). Check if some handovers are unnecessary (like triggered by spurious measurements or false pilots   maybe interference making neighbor look good when it's not). If so; adjust the measurement filtering. After tuning; monitor handover success and ping-pong rate   success should remain high (we don't want to stop needed handovers) but ping-pong count should decrease. The RRC connection drop rate may improve because fewer handover failures in ping-pong scenarios. Also the control plane load on that cluster of cells should drop; freeing capacity for actual new connections or data. Possibly also battery life of UEs in that area improves (less signaling means less power usage on their side too)
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,High VSWR Alarm on Sector 2;Improperly seated feeder cable on Sector 2 antenna; Physical damage or corrosion in Sector 2 feeder line; Water ingress causing high reflection,Examine all Sector 2 antenna feed line connectors for looseness or corrosion; Dry and reseal any moisture-affected connectors or cables; If VSWR remains high; consider replacing the antenna or feeder; After repairs; reset the alarm and verify VSWR is within acceptable range
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Power Amplifier Failure on Sector 3;Sector 3 power amplifier module hardware fault; Overheating of the PA module; Electrical surge damaging the amplifier,Check the alarms or indicators on the Sector 3 radio unit for PA module faults; If the amplifier is removable; power down the unit and replace the Sector 3 PA module; Verify proper cooling and ventilation to prevent repeat overheating; Restore power and test Sector 3 output power to confirm the new amplifier is functioning
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Power Amplifier Failure on Sector 1;Hardware failure in Sector 1 RF amplifier; Extended operation at maximum power leading to component stress; Sudden power surge or lightning strike damaging the amplifier,Review Sector 1 transmit power levels and recent weather/power events; Replace the faulty power amplifier component for Sector 1; Inspect surge protectors and grounding to mitigate future surge damage; After replacement; measure Sector 1 power output to ensure it meets specifications
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,RRU Offline (Sector 2);Remote Radio Unit for Sector 2 has lost power; Fronthaul fiber connection to Sector 2 RRU is down; RRU hardware failure or internal fault,Verify power supply to the Sector 2 RRU (ensure breakers and power cables are intact); Check the fronthaul fiber link to the RRU for Link Down or high errors (reseat fiber connectors if needed); Attempt a remote reset of the RRU via OAM; If the RRU does not respond; dispatch field technicians to inspect or replace the unit
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,RRU Offline (Sector 3);No power reaching Sector 3 RRU; Fiber optic cable to Sector 3 RRU is disconnected or broken; Sector 3 RRU suffered an internal malfunction,Confirm the power feed and fuses for the Sector 3 RRU are operational; Inspect the fiber connection and SFP module for Sector 3 RRU (replace or reconnect if necessary); If remote restart fails; perform an on-site check of the RRU and swap it with a spare unit; After restoration; monitor the RRUs status and alarms
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,BBU Processing Board Failure;Baseband processing board in the gNB has malfunctioned or crashed; Possible hardware fatigue or manufacturing defect; Overheating or power issues causing board failure,Check the BBU chassis for any red indicators on processing boards; Attempt to reset the affected board via OAM or by reseating it; If the board does not recover; replace the faulty baseband board with a new unit; After replacement; reload the configuration and verify all cells on that BBU are back on air
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Baseband Unit Overheating Alarm;High temperature in the gNB baseband enclosure due to failed cooling; Site air-conditioning outage or high ambient temperature; Clogged air filters or blocked ventilation,Inspect the site cooling system (fans/air conditioning) to ensure proper operation; Clear any obstructions or dust in the BBU vents and filters to improve airflow; If any fans have failed; replace them to restore cooling; Monitor the BBU temperature sensor readings to ensure the temperature drops to normal levels
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Cooling Fan Failure Alarm;One or more cooling fans in the gNB have stopped working; Fans jammed due to debris or wear; Power supply to fan failed or fan reached end of life,Identify which fan unit reported failure via OAM logs; If possible; reboot the fan controller to see if it was a false alarm; If the fan is not spinning; schedule a maintenance window to replace the defective fan; In the meantime; reduce equipment load if possible to avoid overheating; After replacement; verify all fans are operational and clear any lingering alarms
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Spectrum Exhaustion (All resource blocks in use);All available spectrum in use; No free PRBs to schedule new data; Essentially throughput capacity fully utilized given current bandwidth; Could indicate need for more spectrum or cells,Coordinate with spectrum planning to refarm or add spectrum if possible; Enable carrier aggregation with another band if available to boost capacity; Implement massive MIMO or spatial multiplexing to use spectrum more efficiently (if not already); Offload traffic where possible (small cells; Wi-Fi offload; or encourage devices to use LTE anchor for less data); In the short term; enforce fairness (ensure no single UE monopolizes resources); Long term; consider splitting the cell or deploying additional sites to reuse spectrum and handle demand; Monitor cell throughput after actions   should improve only with additional spectrum or better spatial reuse; otherwise consider user demand management strategies
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SSB Beam Limit Reached;gNB configured more SSB beams than supported or needs more beams than available; Possibly trying to cover too wide area with limited beams; Could also mean hardware supports fewer beams than configured,Verify number of SSB beams configured vs hardware support (e.g.; 8; 16; 64 beams). If over-configured; reduce to supported count; If coverage gaps exist due to limited beams; consider adding another cell or using wider beamwidth SSB to cover missing areas (trade-off is lower SSB signal per beam); Ensure SSB beams are properly oriented (tilt/azimuth) to cover the service area   adjust if some beams wasted; If hardware limitation is the issue; upgrade to an antenna/radio that supports more beams if needed; After changes; test initial access around the cell to ensure UEs can detect at least one SSB in all intended coverage areas; Monitor RACH success rate to verify improvement
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Too Many Handovers (Signaling Overload);Excessive handovers (e.g.; dense small cells causing frequent UE handover or ping-pong); Mobility thresholds possibly too aggressive; High-speed UEs triggering many cell changes in short time,Review handover logs for ping-pong events or very short intervals between handovers; Increase time-to-trigger or hysteresis for handover triggers to reduce unnecessary handovers; Use conditional handover or dual connectivity for fast-moving UEs to reduce hard HO frequency; If small cells are too small for driving speeds; consider strategic macro umbrella coverage to catch fast UEs and reduce load on small cells; After parameter tuning; monitor handover success/failure rates and ping-pong counts   should improve (fewer unnecessary handovers and fewer failures due to rushed handovers); This will also reduce signaling load on RAN and core

As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Baseband CPU 100% Utilization;Baseband processor fully saturated (100% CPU usage); Possibly too many active UEs or heavy features enabled (massive MIMO; Carrier Agg; etc.); Could also indicate software inefficiency or runaway process,Check the number of active UEs and features vs. hardware capacity; If over capacity; offload users to other cells or reduce optional feature usage (e.g.; temporarily disable secondary carrier or heavy traffic features) to relieve CPU; If within expected load; consult vendor for known issues   perhaps a software patch is needed if CPU shouldn't be maxed; Rebooting the node can clear any runaway processes temporarily; but address root cause (e.g.; scheduling inefficiency or misconfiguration causing extra load); Consider hardware upgrade or adding an extra baseband unit if site consistently at CPU limit; Monitor CPU after changes   it should drop below 100% with some headroom; and KPIs like latency or throughput per user should improve if CPU was a bottleneck
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Memory Exhaustion on gNB;gNB RAM usage at maximum; Could be genuine load (many UEs; large buffers) or a memory leak in software; If memory full; new sessions may fail and system could crash or restart,Access memory utilization stats from OAM; If usage steadily climbs over time regardless of traffic (likely a leak); coordinate with vendor for a software fix   in the interim; schedule periodic reboots during low traffic to avoid crashes; If usage correlates with high traffic (lots of UEs/data); consider adding memory (if hardware allows) or upgrading to a higher capacity unit; Also; optimize configuration: disable verbose logging or tracing that consumes memory; and ensure any large data buffers (e.g.; for debugging) are turned off; Free up memory by clearing old logs or crash dumps stored locally; After actions; watch memory usage   it should stay within safe limits (e.g.; below ~80% at peak) and not continually creep upward; Memory-related alarms should clear and stability improve
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,RRU Processor Overload;Remote Radio Units processing (DSP/FPGA inside RRU) is overloaded; Possibly too many carriers or MIMO layers configured on one RRU beyond spec; Heavy uplink interference can also increase RRU processing burden significantly,Check RRU configuration: ensure number of carriers and MIMO layers on that RRU do not exceed its capacity (refer to spec   e.g.; some RRUs can only handle certain bandwidth or combinations); If over-configured; redistribute carriers to another RRU or reduce layers; Inspect uplink noise/interference levels   if RRU is spending cycles on error correction due to noise; identify and mitigate the interference source (could involve spectrum analysis and filtering); Update RRU firmware to the latest version in case of efficiency improvements or known issues; If overload persists even under supported config; consider hardware expansion (add another RRU to split sectors or upgrade to a higher-capacity RRU model); Monitor RRU CPU/DSP load after changes   it should drop to normal range; and the overload alarm should cease
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Max Connected UEs Exceeded;UE count connected to cell exceeds configured or licensed maximum; Common during mass events or if neighboring cells failed and all users camp on this cell; New users will fail to attach while limit exceeded,Verify current UE count vs allowed maximum via OAM; If legitimately high due to an event; deploy temporary capacity (e.g.; a COLT or additional small cell) to distribute load; If neighbors are down; restore them ASAP or shrink this cells footprint via antenna tilt to encourage UEs back to their own cells when they recover; Consider increasing UE license count if possible and if hardware supports it; Implement admission control to reject low-priority access attempts once near limit (ensuring emergency and priority users still get through); After event or neighbor recovery; UE count should fall below threshold and new UEs can attach normally; For long term; plan for capacity expansions in this area (additional cells or higher-capacity baseband) to handle higher UE volumes
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Signaling Storm / RRC Connection Surge;A sudden surge of RRC connection attempts overwhelming the control plane; Happens after outages (all UEs reconnect simultaneously) or due to misbehaving devices repeatedly reconnecting; Can also be caused by malicious attack flooding connection requests,If caused by recovery from outage; implement staggered reconnect: power on sectors in sequence or use random access barring to spread UE connection attempts over a longer period; Identify if specific UEs or a software bug is causing continuous reconnection loops  trace logs for frequent attach attempts by same UE and quarantine or reset that UEs state (could involve core network to block a misbehaving SIM temporarily); Ensure overload control features are active: e.g.; gNB should start rejecting some requests when CPU high to protect itself (tune thresholds if needed); In case of suspected DoS attack; engage security to filter traffic at source or network edge; Once measures in place; monitor RRC success rate and attempt rate   success should improve and CPU load should stabilize; Document the event and adjust network design if needed (e.g.; smaller TA lists; etc.; to reduce signaling per outage scenario)
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Downlink PRB Utilization 100%;All downlink Physical Resource Blocks are continuously in use; reflecting constant full load on downlink; Typically due to high user demand (e.g.; many streaming/download sessions); Can cause scheduling delays for new traffic,Confirm via performance stats that DL PRB utilization is at 100% for extended periods; If uplink PRBs are lower; then specifically downlink is the bottleneck likely heavy content consumption; Implement temporal traffic shaping if needed (for example; rate-limit certain non-traffic types during peak hours via core network) to ensure control and VoIP traffic still get scheduled promptly; Activate additional spectrum if possible or use EN-DC (LTE anchor) to offload some data to 4G if 5G is saturated; Small cell deployment in hotspots covered by this cell can offload some users and free PRBs; In immediate terms; there's little to do on RAN side except ensure scheduler is not stuck or misallocating check that no UE has an undue share (unless by QoS design); After any offload actions; check if DL PRB usage has any headroom at peak (even 90% instead of 100% is improvement) and if latency for downlink sensitive apps improves; Continue to pursue capacity upgrades; as consistently 100% DL usage is a strong indicator for need of more capacity
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Uplink Interference Causing Retransmission Overload;High uplink interference (external or internal) leading to many uplink errors; UEs and gNB keep retransmitting packets (HARQ; ARQ) which consumes resources and lowers overall capacity; Can also raise noise floor for other cells,Examine uplink SINR and noise figures if poor despite normal load; use spectrum analyzer or interference hunting tools to find external sources (could be unauthorized transmitters or faulty equipment nearby emitting noise); If an interfering UE (like a malfunctioning phone) is suspected; try identifying it by unusual uplink metrics and have it removed or repaired; Temporarily increase uplink power control max for UEs to overcome mild interference (with caution; as it increases inter-cell interference) for severe interference; better to remove source; Ensure uplink filters and duplexers are working (a hardware fault could let outside signals in); After interference mitigation; monitor UL BLER (block error rate) it should drop; and uplink throughput per UE should improve; Also; CPU load on gNB might decrease because it's not handling constant retransmissions; The noise floor as seen in OAM should return to normal baseline
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Neighbor List Table Full;The configured neighbor list on the gNB (used for handovers and measurements) has reached its maximum entries; No new neighbor cells can be added; meaning if new cells were built nearby or need to be neighbors; they can't be configured until space is freed; Could be an A3 algorithm adding too many neighbors dynamically,Audit the neighbor list via OAM and if it includes obsolete or redundant entries (cells that are switched off or rarely handed to); remove those to free slots; Ensure that important neighbors are retained (especially those with frequent handovers) and that list isn't bloated by very distant cells due to aggressive automation; If an Automatic Neighbor Relation function is adding too many; adjust its parameters (like stronger threshold for adding or smaller search radius); Check vendor documentation for neighbor list capacity and if network design truly needs more than that; you might split the cell into two sectors logically or wait for a software upgrade that increases capacity; Once list is trimmed; attempt to add the needed neighbor (the one that raised this alarm likely) again and it should succeed now; Verify handover to that neighbor works; Plan a periodic review of neighbor lists to prevent reoccurrence (perhaps an offline tool to suggest removal of neighbors with near-zero handovers)
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Bearer Limit Reached;The total number of radio bearers (data flows) active has hit the limit (distinct from UE count   one UE can have multiple bearers for different QoS); A high number of multi-QoS sessions (VoNR + data; etc.) or split bearers in EN-DC could drive this count up,Analyze how many bearers per UE on average and if each UE has many (maybe due to slicing or multiple PDU sessions); see if any consolidation is feasible (like ensure non-apps share the default bearer rather than spawning new ones); Confirm with vendor what the bearer limit is   sometimes increasing memory or license can raise it; If short-term fix needed; you might restrict new secondary bearers: for example; temporarily disallow non-GBR secondary QoS flows in that cell so that each UE only uses a primary bearer; reducing total count; Evaluate EN-DC config NSA dual connectivity uses bearers on both LTE and NR; ensure the limit accounts for that (if not; maybe reduce EN-DC usage in extreme load via core policy so some UEs stay on LTE only for data; freeing 5G bearers); After mitigation; new session/bearer establishment should succeed where they were failing; KPI to watch: ERAB setup success (or 5G PDU session setup success) should go back to ~100% if bearer limit was the issue; Long run: upgrade gNB software/hardware to support more bearers or architect core policies to limit bearers per UE
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Scheduler Overload (Too many active flows);The MAC scheduler is struggling with the number of simultaneous flows to schedule each TTI; Could result in suboptimal scheduling or increased latency as it can compute decisions fast enough; Often seen when many UEs are active with varying QoS needs or after enabling a complex scheduling feature without enough CPU headroom,If possible; monitor the scheduling cycle time   some systems report if scheduling computations exceeded the TTI; A quick fix can be to reduce complexity: for instance; if features like proportional fairness with QoS weighting are too heavy; simplify them or reduce number of QoS classes; Limit how many UEs can be scheduled in one TTI by raising the scheduling interval for low-priority traffic (some schedulers allow e.g.; schedule certain data every 2ms instead of every 1ms for background flows); Ensure the baseband CPU isn throttled (check if CPU upgrade or more cores assignment can help the scheduler); Verify if any debug or trace mode is on for scheduler   if so; turn it off; as it could slow processing; After adjustments; check latency of scheduling-sensitive services (like URLLC or voice)   should decrease if scheduler was the bottleneck; And the cell throughput may increase since the scheduler can make better decisions in time; Work with vendor on tuning parameters specifically for high user counts   they often have guidelines for large numbers of active UEs
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Downlink Buffer Overflow;The downlink buffers (e.g.; PDCP or RLC queues) in the gNB overflowed; meaning the gNB received more downlink data from the core than it could send out over the air; This leads to packet drops at the RAN; impacting user throughput; Possibly due to insufficient flow control between gNB and core (UPF),Check if the gNB supports sending congestion indications to the core (e.g.; an S1-AP or N2 message for congestion; or marking in GTP-U); If yes; ensure its enabled so the core slows down sending when RAN is congested; Investigate if particular UEs or flows cause sudden bursts   maybe a large file download started while cell already near capacity; If so; implementing pacing in the core (UPF) per flow could help (spread data over more time); Increase the size of downlink buffers slightly if memory allows (but be cautious not to introduce too much latency); As an immediate fix; restart of user-plane function might flush buffers but doesn solve cause; Monitor for pattern: if it happens at peak hours regularly; treat it as capacity issue   more radio resources or sector split needed; After enabling flow control; you should see the core reduce traffic when RAN congested; preventing overflow   verify by checking if future similar load doesn trigger buffer overflow alarms and user throughput stabilizes rather than dropping completely
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Uplink Buffer Overflow;Uplink data buffered in gNB (awaiting forwarding to core) has exceeded capacity; causing drops; Could be because core or transport is slow (backhaul congestion) so packets pile up at gNB; Or gNB is not scheduling uplink fast enough to drain UE buffers; but more commonly core side issue,Check backhaul usage   if backhaul is saturated; thats likely the cause (see 'Backhaul Capacity Saturated'); If core processing is lagging (less common); maybe the core UPF or SGW is overwhelmed   check end-to-end; Implement uplink flow control: in LTE; eNB could send BSR (Buffer Status Report) restrictions or similar   in 5G; ensure the gNB is communicating any congestion to UEs (though UE primarily controlled via scheduling grants); If backhaul is the issue; treat with similar steps as backhaul congestion: rate limit or upgrade link; Short term; you might reduce the UL traffic generation: e.g.; discourage large UL file uploads in that cell via policy temporarily; If UL buffer overflow is in RLC; maybe shorten the RLC retransmission persistence so it drops stale packets faster freeing buffer for new; After fixes; monitor uplink packet drop counters   they should reduce; Users should see improved upload throughput consistency (less stalling); Ensure that any QoS for uplink is honoring priorities (so that; say; control traffic isn't lost if buffers overflow   drop lower priority first)
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Control Plane CPU Overload;The portion of processing handling control-plane (RRC signaling; NAS messages; etc.) is overloaded; Might manifest as delayed RRC responses; timeouts in handovers; or paging delays; Usually due to either too many control events (lots of handovers; attaches) or insufficient processing allocation for control tasks,Correlate events: is there a spike in mobility; paging; or reconfigurations? If yes; try to optimize those parameters (like we did for handovers and RACH) to reduce unnecessary signaling; If control CPU is separate (in a vRAN environment; maybe separate threads or container); ensure it has enough CPU share   increase its vCPU allocation or priority; Check for any non-control tasks running too often   e.g.; if the gNB is attempting to report too many measurement events or doing very frequent periodic updates for idle UEs; tune those timers to reduce load; In extreme cases; you could restrict new connections temporarily (like an overload indicator to core to slow down new call attempts) until CPU stabilizes; After actions; measure RRC setup time and success; and paging response times   these should improve if control CPU is no longer pegged; Also watch the control CPU usage metric if available   should come down below threshold (often <70% is desired for headroom); If not improved; escalate to vendor   maybe need hardware with more CPU or a software patch to optimize control plane processing
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Paging Capacity Exhausted;Too many UEs in the tracking area cause more paging requests than the cell can handle per paging cycle; Some page messages get dropped or delayed; leading to missed incoming calls/data for idle UEs; Often if TA covers very populous area or if core sends broad pages (e.g.; for emergency alerts or during disasters),Check how many paging occasions per second the cell can handle vs how many are being attempted   if TA is huge; coordinate with core team to split it (reduce number of cells per TA so each cell pages fewer UEs on average); If not possible to reconfigure TA quickly; increase the paging capacity on this cell: if standard is 4 paging messages per frame; see if vendor allows 8 (at cost of some PDSCH resources); Ensure extended paging cycle for non-UEs (like IoT) to reduce paging load   IoT devices can listen less often; saving capacity for phone paging; Consider enabling cell broadcast for mass notifications (so one broadcast message replaces thousands of individual pages in emergencies); After changes; monitor paging success rate and the number of discarded pages   success should improve and discards drop; UEs should receive pages more reliably; Also keep an eye on RAN utilization since adding paging capacity uses a bit of downlink resources   ensure its an acceptable trade-off; Adjust TA planning in the long term to balance idle UE counts across different areas

As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Periodic spikes in latency and packet loss on a 5G TDD network at regular intervals;TDD synchronization issues causing interference: neighboring cells might be misaligned in their uplink/downlink slot timing. When one cell is transmitting while another expects to receive; it causes cross-interference; affecting latency and packet delivery,Check and ensure all neighboring TDD cells are using the same frame configuration and are GPS-synchronized; adjust any out-of-sync cell to align its uplink/downlink switching with the network; and monitor the latency to see if the periodic interference-induced spikes disappear
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Lower than expected 5G data rates at a site co-located with 4G; despite strong signal;Interference between collocated 4G and 5G equipment due to insufficient isolation. High-power LTE transmissions or poor filtering may desensitize the 5G receiver or create intermodulation products in shared infrastructure,Investigate the site installation for proper RF filters and isolation between 4G and 5G antennas; install additional filtering or physical separation if needed; and adjust power levels or antenna spacing. Verify improved 5G throughput after mitigating the cross-technology interference
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Upload speeds on 5G are significantly lower than download speeds; especially at cell edges;Coverage imbalance where downlink is strong but uplink struggles. Uplink signal from the UE is weaker (due to UE power limits and distance); resulting in poor UL SINR at the gNodeB. This leads to lower modulation and coding on uplink and reduced throughput,Examine uplink SINR and power headroom reports from UEs at the cell edge. Optimize uplink power control parameters or consider deploying an uplink-specific enhancement (like supplemental UL carrier or receive diversity at the gNodeB). In coverage planning; ensure balanced link budget for UL and DL. After adjustments; test UE upload performance at the edges to confirm improvement
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Phones frequently stay on 4G LTE even though a 5G signal is available nearby;Cell reselection priorities or threshold settings are not optimized; causing UEs to prefer the 4G network unless 5G signal is very strong. It could also be that the 5G small cell is not broadcast with enough attractiveness or the UE has conservative settings to camp on 5G,Review the reselection parameters (such as S-NonIntrasearch; thresholdX Low/High) broadcast by 5G and 4G cells. Increase the priority or lower the threshold for 5G so that UEs switch to 5G at higher signal levels. Also ensure 4G cells are properly informing UEs of nearby 5G (NR ARFCN and priority in LTE SIB). Test with a device in the area to see if it now camps on 5G as expected
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Two sectors on the same site seem to interfere with each other; causing inconsistent coverage boundaries and throughput dips;Antenna pattern overlap or a configuration issue is causing sectors to overshoot. Possibly the sectors have identical Physical Cell IDs or the antennas are improperly angled; leading to interference in the overlap region and confused handovers,Conduct a drive test around the site to map coverage of each sector. Verify that each sector has a unique PCI to avoid confusion. If overshoot is observed; adjust the antenna tilt or orientation to better confine each sector s coverage. Update neighbor lists to handle the overlap region effectively. After changes; re-test to ensure that each sector covers its intended area without causing interference to the other
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Significant signal fading and throughput variation in a downtown area with many glass-sided buildings;Severe multipath and reflections are causing fast fading of the 5G signal. The environment creates rapidly changing constructive and destructive interference patterns; so even with good average signal; momentary deep fades occur; reducing throughput stability,Use advanced features like beamforming and MIMO to mitigate urban canyon effects. Ensure the gNodeB s beam management is optimized for high-multipath environments (perhaps enabling spatial diversity modes). In extreme cases; add more small cells to provide alternate coverage angles. Test the area with throughput measurements: the goal is to see smoother performance (less variance) after optimizations
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,In a newly developed area; coverage is unexpectedly poor because a planned cell is effectively blocked by a new building;A large new structure is attenuating or reflecting the 5G signal; creating a shadow zone. The network design didn t account for this obstacle; resulting in a coverage hole where users experience low signal and data rates,Update the coverage prediction model with the new building and verify the hole. To fix; modify the existing site (e.g.; raise antenna height or change orientation) or deploy an additional small cell/microcell to cover the shadowed area. Alternatively; consider if a lower-frequency 5G band could cover it better. Once changes are made; measure signal levels in the area to confirm that coverage has been restored to acceptable levels
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Some users installed personal 5G signal boosters and now experience even worse connectivity;Improperly installed consumer signal boosters are oscillating and causing interference. Instead of improving signal; these boosters can create noise and even drown out the cell s downlink if they feed back into their own antenna; degrading service for the user and possibly neighbors,Identify through spectrum analysis detecting oscillation signatures if users in the area are using unauthorized boosters. Educate users to remove or properly configure these devices (or better; rely on network-provided solutions like femtocells or authorized repeaters). Once the interfering booster is turned off; check the affected users  connection quality again on the macro network to ensure it has returned to normal
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Coverage maps show 5G available; but a small valley or low-lying spot has no reception;A geographic coverage hole: due to terrain (a dip or valley) the 5G signal from surrounding sites doesn t reach that spot. The map may have over-generalized coverage; but in reality the spot is shadowed by hills or terrain features,Perform targeted drive or walk testing in the reported dead zone to confirm the lack of signal. Adjust the RF plan: possibly tilt a nearby site s antenna down less or add a repeater or small cell specifically for the valley. Alternatively; consider deploying a lower-frequency 5G band for better reach. After network adjustments; test in that location again to verify that 5G signal is now present and usable
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Indoor 5G coverage in a large building is poor except near windows;The macro 5G signals (especially mid/high band) are not penetrating deep inside the building. Materials like concrete and metal obstruct the signal; so only areas close to the outside (windows) get decent coverage,Plan an indoor coverage solution: deploy a Distributed Antenna System (DAS) or dedicated 5G small cells inside the building to distribute the signal. Alternatively; use lower-frequency bands (if available) that penetrate better; though capacity may be lower. Work with the building management to install the necessary infrastructure. Once deployed; test inside various parts of the building to ensure that previously dead zones now have strong 5G service
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Mobile 5G users experience frequent ping-pong handovers between two specific cells;Handover hysteresis and time-to-trigger values are too low; causing the network to repeatedly hand UEs back and forth for small signal gains. Essentially; both cells have similar signal strength at the border; and the UE bounces between them due to tight settings,Increase the handover hysteresis or time-to-trigger for the affected cell pair to require a more definitive signal superiority before switching. Alternatively; adjust cell individual offset biases to favor one cell if appropriate. After parameter tuning; monitor the handover logs to ensure the ping-pong behavior is reduced and connections are more stable
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,When 5G coverage is lost; the data session does not smoothly transition to LTE; resulting in a drop;Inter-RAT handover or fallback from 5G to 4G is failing due to a configuration or signaling issue. Possibly the 4G target is not properly configured as a fallback (in NSA; maybe a missing configuration; in SA; an EPS Fallback issue with the core interworking),Verify the handover/fallback settings: In NSA mode; ensure that the LTE master node is prepared to take over (or that the UE can continue on LTE). In SA mode; check that EPS Fallback via the N26 interface is configured between 5G core and LTE core. Fix any misconfigurations or timer mismatches. Test by moving a UE from 5G to a 4G-only area and ensure the session continues on LTE without dropping
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Notable ping spikes or brief data stalls whenever a 5G handover occurs between gNodeBs;Suboptimal handover execution; possibly because Xn-based handover is not functioning and the network defaults to a core-network (NG) handover which has a longer interruption; or because data forwarding between source and target gNB is failing; causing packet loss,Check the configuration and status of the Xn interface between the involved gNodeBs; ensure that Xn handovers are enabled and that the gNBs have connectivity (no firewall or IP issues) for Xn signaling. If Xn is available; ensure data forwarding is configured during HO. Apply any vendor recommended settings to minimize HO interruption time. Then measure latency during handovers again to confirm improvement
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Handover from a mmWave 5G cell to a mid-band 5G cell frequently fails; dropping the connection;Inter-frequency handover issue likely due to a missing neighbor relation or measurement gap problem. The mmWave cell might not be instructing the UE to measure the mid-band neighbor (or vice versa); so the handover trigger never properly occurs; or occurs too late with weak signal,Ensure that the mmWave cell has the mid-band cell configured as a neighbor with appropriate measurement events (and that UEs can get measurement gaps to scan the other frequency). Similarly; configure the mid-band cell to accept handovers from the mmWave cell. If needed; utilize dual connectivity as a bridge between bands. After updating the neighbor list and measurement configuration; test the frequency change scenario to verify the UE can transition without dropping
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G connections on a highway frequently drop as vehicles move at high speed through the network;Mobility parameters are not tuned for high-speed scenarios. The default handover algorithm might not anticipate fast-moving UEs; leading to late handovers or cells holding onto UEs longer than they should when on the move; causing drops at high speeds,Activate or adjust the high-mobility settings on the network: for example; reduce time-to-trigger and use larger handover margins for UEs identified as high-speed; or enable features like conditional handover if supported. Make sure neighboring cell definitions along the highway are comprehensive. After adjustments; test drive along the highway to ensure that handovers occur seamlessly at speed and drops are reduced
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,A successful handover is immediately followed by a drop on the new cell;The target cell accepts the handover but then quickly releases the connection. This could be due to a resource admission issue (target cell low on resources) or a security/context mismatch causing the target to drop the UE after handover,Examine the target cell s logs for clues right after handover (e.g.; an RRC or NAS release cause). If it indicates resource issues; adjust admission thresholds or ensure sufficient capacity is reserved for handovers. If it s a security failure; ensure the encryption/integrity algorithms and keys are transferred correctly (consistent configuration between source and target). After making corrections; test handovers to that cell to confirm that it no longer drops the connection post-handover
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Inter-vendor 5G handovers (between different vendor gNodeBs) often fail or are aborted;Interoperability issue where the two vendors  equipment have slight differences in handover signaling implementation. This can lead to incompatibility in Xn handover procedures or capability mismatches; causing handover failure,Work with both vendors to obtain the latest firmware that addresses known interoperability bugs. Configure any recommended interop parameters (for example; disabling non-extensions in HO signaling). If Xn handover remains problematic; allow the handover via the core (as a temporary measure) which is more standardized. Test handovers between the multi-vendor cells after updates to ensure success
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,UEs frequently switch between 5G and 4G (or between 5G cells) within seconds; affecting throughput;Overly aggressive inter-system handover/reselection settings. The network might be attempting to keep the UE on 5G even when the signal is marginal; leading to frequent toggling between 5G and 4G; or between two 5G cells with marginal coverage. This constant switching prevents stable throughput,Reevaluate and adjust the threshold settings for 5G to LTE fallback and reselection. Implement a stronger hysteresis so that once a UE switches to LTE due to weak 5G; it doesn t immediately switch back to 5G until the 5G signal is solid. Similarly; fine-tune intra-5G handover criteria to avoid chasing marginal signal. Monitor the handover/reselection logs after changes to confirm that the toggling frequency has reduced and user throughput has stabilized
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Random handover failures between specific cells at times; even though configuration looks correct;Inter-gNB Xn interface instability or high latency can intermittently disrupt the handover signaling exchange. If the Xn control plane messages are delayed or lost; the handover will fail despite proper configurations,Check the health of the Xn interface linking those gNodeBs (packet loss; latency spikes; or routing issues). Ensure reliable IP connectivity for Xn traffic  for instance; remove any congestion or flaky link in that path. If persistent; consider routing Xn over a different path or temporarily use core-assisted handovers. Once the transport is stabilized; validate by repeating handovers between the cells to ensure they consistently succeed without drops
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Persistently low throughput and high uplink interference levels on a 5G cell;Strong co-channel interference from a nearby cell using the same frequency. Overlapping coverage on the same channel is causing the cell s SINR to drop; degrading throughput,Examine network planning data for frequency reuse and neighbor cell overlap; adjust antenna tilt/orientation or change the frequency channel to reduce overlap; and implement inter-cell interference coordination features to mitigate the interference
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Sudden degradation of 5G data speed accompanied by high noise floor readings;External RF interference impacting the 5G band (for example; an unauthorized transmitter or equipment in the area emitting on or near the 5G frequency); which raises the noise floor and disrupts signal decoding,Use a spectrum analyzer or interference hunting tool to detect foreign signals in the 5G band; locate the source of interference (e.g.; jammer or industrial equipment); and work to eliminate it or adjust the 5G frequency plan or filters to avoid the interference
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Good signal strength but poor quality (low SINR) leading to subpar 5G throughput;Passive intermodulation (PIM) issues in the antenna system or feeders causing self-interference. Corroded connectors or close proximity of multiple transmit frequencies can generate intermodulation products that interfere with the 5G signal,Conduct PIM testing at the site to identify any faulty connectors or materials; repair or replace damaged antenna system components; ensure connectors are tight and corrosion-free; and then validate improved SINR and throughput after fixes
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Unstable 5G connection when using a signal booster or repeater; throughput oscillates;An improperly configured or malfunctioning 5G repeater/booster causing self-oscillation or feedback; effectively creating interference on the network it s meant to enhance,Identify if any third-party signal boosters are active in the affected area; disable or correctly reconfigure the device (ensuring proper isolation and gain settings); and monitor the 5G cell performance afterward to confirm stability
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Degraded 5G throughput in areas where 5G and LTE share the same spectrum (DSS);Dynamic Spectrum Sharing misconfiguration or contention causing interference between LTE and NR signals. If the resource partitioning or scheduling between 4G and 5G isn t tuned properly; the two systems can interfere and reduce each other s efficiency,Review the DSS configuration parameters such as scheduling ratios and symbol allocation between LTE and NR; fine-tune the dynamic partitioning to ensure fair and interference-free sharing; and test both 4G and 5G performance to confirm improvements
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Localized poor 5G performance near equipment using adjacent frequency bands;Adjacent-channel interference from a transmitter operating in a neighboring band (such as radar; fixed wireless; or another carrier s network) bleeding into the 5G band and causing receiver desensitization,Perform spectrum analysis to identify interference at band edges; coordinate with the source if possible (e.g.; adjust their transmit filters or frequencies); improve the 5G base station s filtering or frequency separation; and verify that the 5G receiver noise floor returns to normal
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,High uplink noise and reduced uplink throughput observed on a 5G cell;A rogue or malfunctioning UE (user device) transmitting continuously or a jamming device is raising the uplink noise floor. This constant interference competes with legitimate user signals; resulting in lower uplink SNR for all users,Activate uplink spectrum monitoring on the cell to detect abnormal continuous transmissions; use direction-finding equipment to locate the source of the interference; remove or disable the offending device; and then confirm that uplink noise and throughput return to expected levels
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,In a mmWave 5G hotspot; throughput drops sharply when certain objects move or are present;Intermittent signal blockage or reflections at mmWave frequencies causing self-interference. Movement of large vehicles or reflective surfaces can redirect beams and momentarily interfere with the line-of-sight signal,Perform a site survey to identify potential reflective or blocking objects; adjust beamforming parameters or base station placement to minimize reliance on single reflections; and implement beam redundancy or switching strategies to maintain throughput even with obstructions
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Periodic spikes in latency and packet loss on a 5G TDD network at regular intervals;TDD synchronization issues causing interference: neighboring cells might be misaligned in their uplink/downlink slot timing. When one cell is transmitting while another expects to receive; it causes cross-interference; affecting latency and packet delivery,Check and ensure all neighboring TDD cells are using the same frame configuration and are GPS-synchronized; adjust any out-of-sync cell to align its uplink/downlink switching with the network; and monitor the latency to see if the periodic interference-induced spikes disappear
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Lower than expected 5G data rates at a site co-located with 4G; despite strong signal;Interference between collocated 4G and 5G equipment due to insufficient isolation. High-power LTE transmissions or poor filtering may desensitize the 5G receiver or create intermodulation products in shared infrastructure,Investigate the site installation for proper RF filters and isolation between 4G and 5G antennas; install additional filtering or physical separation if needed; and adjust power levels or antenna spacing. Verify improved 5G throughput after mitigating the cross-technology interference
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G data sessions drop or reset after a fixed time (e.g.; every 30 minutes) for multiple users;A core network timer or software bug is causing session teardown. For instance; an idle timeout or session lifetime in the SMF/UPF might be misconfigured; or a NAT timeout in the network is closing connections; leading to session resets,Identify if there's a common timing to the drop (check SMF session logs for a pattern). If an idle timer is too short; increase it to accommodate typical usage. Check any NAT device for connection timeouts and adjust to match 5G session needs. Also look for known bugs in the SMF software regarding session duration and apply patches. After adjustments; monitor new sessions to ensure they persist as expected without unexpected drops
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G users in a region experience high latency because traffic is being routed through a distant data center;Suboptimal UPF selection in the core network. Users are anchored to a UPF that is geographically far or not local; causing long network paths and latency. The NSSF/SMF might not be selecting the nearest UPF due to config issues,Review the UPF deployment and the configuration for UPF selection (NSSF rules or SMF logic). Ensure that for the affected region; a local UPF is available and properly registered; and that the subscriber/slice is configured to use it. Update the configuration so that new sessions use the closer UPF. Once changed; test latency (e.g.; ping from UE to a local server) to confirm that the routing is now optimal and latency has decreased
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Some 5G users fail to get IP addresses; leaving them without data connectivity;The IP address pool for the 5G data network (managed by the SMF/UPF or a DHCP server) is exhausted or not properly allocated. As a result; new PDU sessions cannot get an IP configuration,Check the configured IP pools for the APN or Data Network in the core network. Determine if the pool is depleted; if so; extend the pool or add a new IP range. Also verify the DHCP function if external (ensure it s operational and has free addresses). After increasing available IP addresses; attempt to establish PDU sessions with the previously failing UEs and confirm they now receive an IP and can pass data
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Devices register on 5G but quickly lose connectivity or get deregistered;A core network authentication or subscription issue could be at play. Possibly the Authentication server (AUSF) or subscriber database (UDM) is malfunctioning; causing the core to drop the user after initial registration. For example; if the security context isn t properly established; the network may detach the UE,Examine the authentication logs (AUSF/UDM) for errors or timeouts. Ensure the subscriber info (credentials; subscription profile) in the UDM is correct and that the AUSF is reachable. If the issue is a core network initiated detach; check the cause (e.g.; Synch failure or Auth reject). Resolve by restarting the AUSF/UDM if hung; or correcting any subscription data mismatches. Then have affected UEs attempt to reconnect and verify they remain registered without unexpected detach
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G users are being throttled to low speeds even though they should have higher bandwidth available;Misconfigured policy control (PCF) or QoS settings resulting in an incorrect low AMBR (Allocated Maximum Bit Rate) for users. They might be incorrectly categorized into a limited-speed profile due to a provisioning error,Inspect the PCF rules and subscriber profiles for the affected UEs to see what QoS and AMBR values are being assigned. If a mistake is found (e.g.; all users tagged as low-tier); update the policy or subscription data to reflect the correct service tier. Make sure the SMF applies the new policy. Then test the data throughput on an affected UE to ensure it can now reach the expected speeds
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Certain applications (e.g.; a specific video streaming or gaming service) aren t working over 5G; though general browsing is fine;A firewall or NAT issue in the 5G core network. Possibly the CG-NAT or firewall is blocking specific ports or protocols required by that application; or the application s traffic isn t properly handled by the UPF (e.g.; missing port forwarding or ALG for that service),Identify the ports/protocols used by the affected application. Check the firewall and NAT rules on the user-plane gateway (UPF or associated firewall). Adjust the configuration to allow the necessary traffic (for instance; enable an ALG or open specific UDP/TCP ports). Additionally; ensure any required QoS for that app is configured if needed. After making changes; test the application on the 5G network to confirm it can connect and function normally
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Noticeable delay when starting a data session after connecting to 5G (slow initial connectivity);The core network might be slow in setting up the user plane due to an overloaded control plane (SMF) or latency in negotiating the session. Alternatively; initial DNS resolution could be slow if the network s DNS isn't responding quickly for first requests,Analyze the PDU Session Establishment time in the core logs. If the SMF shows delays; consider increasing its processing capacity or load-balancing to another SMF instance. Also check the DNS server that UEs are assigned  ensure it s reachable and not overloaded (introduce a local DNS cache if needed). After optimizations; measure the time from attach to first data usage (like opening a webpage) to see if the delay has reduced
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,When a 5G signal is lost and the UE falls back to LTE; the data session drops instead of continuing;Interworking between 5G core and 4G EPC (for fallback) is not functioning. The N26 interface (5GC-EPC interworking) might not be configured or there s no context transfer; so when 5G goes away the session isn t handed over to LTE and is lost,Verify whether EPS Fallback / interworking is set up in the network. On the 5G core (AMF); N26 interface should be enabled and connected to the 4G core (MME/SGW). If it s missing; configure the N26 interface and ensure that the 4G core trusts the context from 5GC. If it s configured; check for any errors in the handover procedure. After enabling; test by moving a UE from 5G coverage to LTE-only area and observe if the data session now continues on LTE without dropping
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,High signaling load and CPU usage on core network elements leading to service degradation;Possibly a signaling storm or misbehaving devices causing excessive NAS messages (like continuous re-attaches or PDU session requests). Alternatively; a software fault causing the AMF or SMF to enter a high CPU loop; reducing its ability to handle normal traffic,Monitor the signaling traffic volume on the AMF/SMF. Identify if specific UEs or a flood of messages (e.g.; repeated registration attempts) are present. If it s an external event (DDoS or malfunctioning UE flooding requests); implement rate limiting or block offending sources. If it s an internal software issue; consider rolling back a recent update or applying a patch from the vendor. Scale out additional AMF/SMF instances if necessary to share the load. Once CPU usage normalizes; ensure that registration success rate and other KPIs return to normal
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,All users on a particular network slice have lost connectivity; while other slices are unaffected;A slice-specific core network failure. For instance; the network functions dedicated to that slice (like a slice-specific SMF/UPF or a slice-specific authentication server) may have crashed or become unreachable; isolating that slice s users,Verify the status of core components for the affected slice. If that slice uses separate AMF/SMF/UPF instances; check their health and restart or failover as needed. Ensure the slice s NSSAI configurations are intact and that the NSSF is directing slice traffic correctly. Restore any downed network function for that slice and then test with a UE assigned to that slice to confirm it can register and use data again
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Data sessions are established but then immediately released for many users (connect then disconnect pattern);Likely a core-side issue such as the SMF or PCF immediately tearing down the session due to a policy or error. For example; if the subscribers are not authorized for the requested slice or APN; the core might instantly drop the session after setup,Look at SMF logs to find the cause of the session release (e.g.; DSM (disconnect) cause codes). If it indicates not authorized; verify the users  subscription data for correct slice/APN entitlements. If it s a network error; check for recent configuration changes in SMF/PCF regarding allowed services. Rectify the policy or subscription mismatch so that legitimate sessions are not erroneously dropped. Test by initiating data sessions for an affected user to ensure the connection now remains up
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Core network logs show numerous error messages and some 5G traffic is getting delayed or retransmitted;A misconfiguration or incompatibility on a core interface (such as NGAP between gNB and AMF or GTP-U between gNB and UPF) is causing errors. For instance; an MTU mismatch could lead to fragmentation issues; or a version mismatch in protocols causing errors that necessitate retries,Identify the specific error in the core logs (e.g.; NGAP message parse errors or GTP-U packet drops). If it s MTU related; adjust the MTU settings on the gNB and core interfaces to a common value and ensure path MTU discovery is enabled. If it s a protocol/version issue; ensure all network functions and gNBs are on compatible software releases and configurations. After resolving the mismatch; monitor to see that errors in logs subside and user-plane traffic flows without unusual delays or retries
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Sudden increase in user-plane latency for 5G users without any radio or backhaul alarms;The UPF (user plane function) handling the traffic might be experiencing high load or internal issues; causing slow packet processing. It could also be that traffic got rerouted through a less optimal UPF or a debug feature (like trace) was left enabled; adding latency,Check the UPF performance metrics (CPU; processing queue lengths). If overloaded; consider scaling out with additional UPF instances and load-balancing sessions. Ensure no unnecessary packet inspection or tracing is active on the UPF. Also verify if a recent change caused traffic to shift to a UPF in a farther location. After addressing (like adding more UPF capacity or fixing route); measure end-to-end latency (e.g.; using ping/ traceroute from a UE) to confirm it has returned to normal levels
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Intermittent core network resets causing temporary loss of 5G service (e.g.; AMF restarts visible);A core network software instability  possibly a bug or memory leak in the AMF or related function that triggers a crash/restart after running for some time. Each restart would drop active signaling connections; forcing UEs to re-register,Investigate core dump logs or error reports from the AMF around the time of resets. Engage the vendor for any known issues; apply a software patch or update that addresses the crash. As a mitigation; ensure redundant AMF nodes can pick up sessions (so a single AMF restart doesn t impact all users). After patching; monitor the uptime of the AMF and the continuity of user registrations to ensure the issue is resolved
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,UE can register to 5G but fails to establish a PDU session for data (gets a rejection for data connection);The SMF is rejecting the PDU session setup. This could happen if the requested data network name (DNN/APN) or slice is not permitted for that UE; or if the network doesn t support the requested PDU session type (IPv6 vs IPv4; etc.). It might also be due to missing default route in core for that APN,Check the reject cause for the PDU Session in the signaling trace. If it s an Unknown or missing DNN or Slice not available; update the subscriber s allowed DNN/slice list in the UDM subscription data. If it s an unsupported request (like IPv6 PDP and network only has IPv4 addresses); adjust the allowed PDU types or configure dual-stack support. Implement the necessary configuration changes and then attempt the PDU session setup again; verifying that the UE can now establish a data session successfully
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Users in the same cell have different throughput; and it s traced to differences in core handling;Possibly some users are being routed via a different slice or APN with a capped bandwidth in the core network. A provisioning inconsistency might have placed a subset of users in a restricted QoS category; causing lower throughput for them irrespective of cell conditions,Audit the provisioning of the users experiencing lower throughput. Check their subscription profile and slice/APN assignment. If they re incorrectly assigned to a restricted profile or slice; update their subscription to match the intended service level. Also verify PCF rules to ensure no unintended throttling is applied. After re-provisioning; monitor those users (or test with one of their SIMs) to see if throughput now aligns with others in the same cell under similar conditions
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G users observe that browsing and apps work; but initial connection setup (DNS lookups) are slow;The DNS server provided to 5G users might be responding slowly. It could be overloaded; or the UPF is forwarding DNS queries to a distant server. Alternatively; there might be a delay in the DNS queries passing through the core network,Check what DNS server IP is assigned to the UEs (via DHCP or NAS). Test the response time of that DNS. If high latency; consider using a more local DNS resolver or deploying a caching DNS in the core or at the UPF. Also ensure multiple DNS servers are configured for redundancy. Implement the changes by updating the DHCP options or UDM profile for UEs; then test again by resolving a common hostname from a UE to confirm quicker DNS response times
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,After a core network software upgrade; some UEs did not reconnect automatically until hours later or after a reboot;Stale context issue: The upgrade might have reset or lost the context of those UEs without notifying them; leaving them in a limbo state. The core might think they re still connected (so it doesn t page them) while the UE thinks it s detached (or vice versa). This mismatch prevents immediate reconnection,On noticing the issue; perform a forced detach for the affected UEs from the core side (purge their old sessions in AMF/SMF) so that they are free to reconnect. Alternatively; instruct those users to toggle airplane mode or reboot to trigger a fresh registration. For future upgrades; use a make-before-break strategy or send detach messages to UEs before shutting down to avoid this scenario. Monitor the network post-upgrade to ensure all UEs reconnect properly and no one is left stranded
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G standalone UEs are unable to perform fallback to 4G for voice calls; resulting in call failure (and maybe data interruption);EPS Fallback or RAT fallback for voice (from 5G to 4G) is not configured correctly in the core or not supported by the UE. The UE attempts to place a voice call; the network should move it to LTE (since maybe VoNR is not available); but that procedure fails; dropping the call and potentially the data session,Verify that EPS Fallback is configured in the 5G core (AMF) and that the UE s subscription allows for it. Ensure the 5G cells are broadcasting the appropriate indicators for voice fallback. If the UE doesn't support VoNR; the network should trigger a handover to LTE for the call. Configure the necessary policies and test with an affected UE by initiating a voice call. The expected outcome is the UE switches to LTE and the call succeeds. Also confirm data continuity if possible during that switch
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G devices are unable to register on the network (no 5G service at all in the area);An issue in the 5G core s access management  for example; the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) might be down or overloaded; preventing new registrations. Alternatively; the 5G signaling between gNB and core (NG interface) is disrupted; so registration requests aren t being processed,Check the core network status; especially the AMF handling that area: look for alarms or high CPU load. If the AMF is unresponsive; fail over to a redundant instance or restart the service. Also verify the NG-C signaling link from gNB to AMF (NGAP) is intact (no SCTP failures). After restoring the AMF or signaling link; test with a UE to ensure it can register and obtain service
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,UEs attach to 5G but cannot establish any data sessions (no internet access after registering);A Session Management Function (SMF) or User Plane Function (UPF) fault. The control plane (AMF) allows attach; but the SMF fails to create a PDU session or the UPF tunnel is not set up; so the user gets no data. Possibly the UPF is down or the SMF configuration for default data session is incorrect,Examine the core network logs for PDU Session Establishment procedures. Check if the SMF is responding to the UE s session request and if it allocates an IP. If the SMF is erroring out; restart or failover the SMF. If IP allocation or UPF setup failed; ensure the UPF is reachable and healthy (restart if needed). Once the SMF/UPF issue is resolved; verify that a UE can establish a data session and pass traffic after attach
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G data sessions drop or reset after a fixed time (e.g.; every 30 minutes) for multiple users;A core network timer or software bug is causing session teardown. For instance; an idle timeout or session lifetime in the SMF/UPF might be misconfigured; or a NAT timeout in the network is closing connections; leading to session resets,Identify if there's a common timing to the drop (check SMF session logs for a pattern). If an idle timer is too short; increase it to accommodate typical usage. Check any NAT device for connection timeouts and adjust to match 5G session needs. Also look for known bugs in the SMF software regarding session duration and apply patches. After adjustments; monitor new sessions to ensure they persist as expected without unexpected drops
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G users in a region experience high latency because traffic is being routed through a distant data center;Suboptimal UPF selection in the core network. Users are anchored to a UPF that is geographically far or not local; causing long network paths and latency. The NSSF/SMF might not be selecting the nearest UPF due to config issues,Review the UPF deployment and the configuration for UPF selection (NSSF rules or SMF logic). Ensure that for the affected region; a local UPF is available and properly registered; and that the subscriber/slice is configured to use it. Update the configuration so that new sessions use the closer UPF. Once changed; test latency (e.g.; ping from UE to a local server) to confirm that the routing is now optimal and latency has decreased
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Some 5G users fail to get IP addresses; leaving them without data connectivity;The IP address pool for the 5G data network (managed by the SMF/UPF or a DHCP server) is exhausted or not properly allocated. As a result; new PDU sessions cannot get an IP configuration,Check the configured IP pools for the APN or Data Network in the core network. Determine if the pool is depleted; if so; extend the pool or add a new IP range. Also verify the DHCP function if external (ensure it s operational and has free addresses). After increasing available IP addresses; attempt to establish PDU sessions with the previously failing UEs and confirm they now receive an IP and can pass data
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Devices register on 5G but quickly lose connectivity or get deregistered;A core network authentication or subscription issue could be at play. Possibly the Authentication server (AUSF) or subscriber database (UDM) is malfunctioning; causing the core to drop the user after initial registration. For example; if the security context isn t properly established; the network may detach the UE,Examine the authentication logs (AUSF/UDM) for errors or timeouts. Ensure the subscriber info (credentials; subscription profile) in the UDM is correct and that the AUSF is reachable. If the issue is a core network initiated detach; check the cause (e.g.; Synch failure or Auth reject). Resolve by restarting the AUSF/UDM if hung; or correcting any subscription data mismatches. Then have affected UEs attempt to reconnect and verify they remain registered without unexpected detach
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G users are being throttled to low speeds even though they should have higher bandwidth available;Misconfigured policy control (PCF) or QoS settings resulting in an incorrect low AMBR (Allocated Maximum Bit Rate) for users. They might be incorrectly categorized into a limited-speed profile due to a provisioning error,Inspect the PCF rules and subscriber profiles for the affected UEs to see what QoS and AMBR values are being assigned. If a mistake is found (e.g.; all users tagged as low-tier); update the policy or subscription data to reflect the correct service tier. Make sure the SMF applies the new policy. Then test the data throughput on an affected UE to ensure it can now reach the expected speeds
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Certain applications (e.g.; a specific video streaming or gaming service) aren t working over 5G; though general browsing is fine;A firewall or NAT issue in the 5G core network. Possibly the CG-NAT or firewall is blocking specific ports or protocols required by that application; or the application s traffic isn t properly handled by the UPF (e.g.; missing port forwarding or ALG for that service),Identify the ports/protocols used by the affected application. Check the firewall and NAT rules on the user-plane gateway (UPF or associated firewall). Adjust the configuration to allow the necessary traffic (for instance; enable an ALG or open specific UDP/TCP ports). Additionally; ensure any required QoS for that app is configured if needed. After making changes; test the application on the 5G network to confirm it can connect and function normally
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Noticeable delay when starting a data session after connecting to 5G (slow initial connectivity);The core network might be slow in setting up the user plane due to an overloaded control plane (SMF) or latency in negotiating the session. Alternatively; initial DNS resolution could be slow if the network s DNS isn't responding quickly for first requests,Analyze the PDU Session Establishment time in the core logs. If the SMF shows delays; consider increasing its processing capacity or load-balancing to another SMF instance. Also check the DNS server that UEs are assigned  ensure it s reachable and not overloaded (introduce a local DNS cache if needed). After optimizations; measure the time from attach to first data usage (like opening a webpage) to see if the delay has reduced
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,When a 5G signal is lost and the UE falls back to LTE; the data session drops instead of continuing;Interworking between 5G core and 4G EPC (for fallback) is not functioning. The N26 interface (5GC-EPC interworking) might not be configured or there s no context transfer; so when 5G goes away the session isn t handed over to LTE and is lost,Verify whether EPS Fallback / interworking is set up in the network. On the 5G core (AMF); N26 interface should be enabled and connected to the 4G core (MME/SGW). If it s missing; configure the N26 interface and ensure that the 4G core trusts the context from 5GC. If it s configured; check for any errors in the handover procedure. After enabling; test by moving a UE from 5G coverage to LTE-only area and observe if the data session now continues on LTE without dropping
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,High signaling load and CPU usage on core network elements leading to service degradation;Possibly a signaling storm or misbehaving devices causing excessive NAS messages (like continuous re-attaches or PDU session requests). Alternatively; a software fault causing the AMF or SMF to enter a high CPU loop; reducing its ability to handle normal traffic,Monitor the signaling traffic volume on the AMF/SMF. Identify if specific UEs or a flood of messages (e.g.; repeated registration attempts) are present. If it s an external event (DDoS or malfunctioning UE flooding requests); implement rate limiting or block offending sources. If it s an internal software issue; consider rolling back a recent update or applying a patch from the vendor. Scale out additional AMF/SMF instances if necessary to share the load. Once CPU usage normalizes; ensure that registration success rate and other KPIs return to normal
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,All users on a particular network slice have lost connectivity; while other slices are unaffected;A slice-specific core network failure. For instance; the network functions dedicated to that slice (like a slice-specific SMF/UPF or a slice-specific authentication server) may have crashed or become unreachable; isolating that slice s users,Verify the status of core components for the affected slice. If that slice uses separate AMF/SMF/UPF instances; check their health and restart or failover as needed. Ensure the slice s NSSAI configurations are intact and that the NSSF is directing slice traffic correctly. Restore any downed network function for that slice and then test with a UE assigned to that slice to confirm it can register and use data again
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Data sessions are established but then immediately released for many users (connect then disconnect pattern);Likely a core-side issue such as the SMF or PCF immediately tearing down the session due to a policy or error. For example; if the subscribers are not authorized for the requested slice or APN; the core might instantly drop the session after setup,Look at SMF logs to find the cause of the session release (e.g.; DSM (disconnect) cause codes). If it indicates not authorized; verify the users  subscription data for correct slice/APN entitlements. If it s a network error; check for recent configuration changes in SMF/PCF regarding allowed services. Rectify the policy or subscription mismatch so that legitimate sessions are not erroneously dropped. Test by initiating data sessions for an affected user to ensure the connection now remains up
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Core network logs show numerous error messages and some 5G traffic is getting delayed or retransmitted;A misconfiguration or incompatibility on a core interface (such as NGAP between gNB and AMF or GTP-U between gNB and UPF) is causing errors. For instance; an MTU mismatch could lead to fragmentation issues; or a version mismatch in protocols causing errors that necessitate retries,Identify the specific error in the core logs (e.g.; NGAP message parse errors or GTP-U packet drops). If it s MTU related; adjust the MTU settings on the gNB and core interfaces to a common value and ensure path MTU discovery is enabled. If it s a protocol/version issue; ensure all network functions and gNBs are on compatible software releases and configurations. After resolving the mismatch; monitor to see that errors in logs subside and user-plane traffic flows without unusual delays or retries
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Sudden increase in user-plane latency for 5G users without any radio or backhaul alarms;The UPF (user plane function) handling the traffic might be experiencing high load or internal issues; causing slow packet processing. It could also be that traffic got rerouted through a less optimal UPF or a debug feature (like trace) was left enabled; adding latency,Check the UPF performance metrics (CPU; processing queue lengths). If overloaded; consider scaling out with additional UPF instances and load-balancing sessions. Ensure no unnecessary packet inspection or tracing is active on the UPF. Also verify if a recent change caused traffic to shift to a UPF in a farther location. After addressing (like adding more UPF capacity or fixing route); measure end-to-end latency (e.g.; using ping/ traceroute from a UE) to confirm it has returned to normal levels
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Intermittent core network resets causing temporary loss of 5G service (e.g.; AMF restarts visible);A core network software instability  possibly a bug or memory leak in the AMF or related function that triggers a crash/restart after running for some time. Each restart would drop active signaling connections; forcing UEs to re-register,Investigate core dump logs or error reports from the AMF around the time of resets. Engage the vendor for any known issues; apply a software patch or update that addresses the crash. As a mitigation; ensure redundant AMF nodes can pick up sessions (so a single AMF restart doesn t impact all users). After patching; monitor the uptime of the AMF and the continuity of user registrations to ensure the issue is resolved
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,UE can register to 5G but fails to establish a PDU session for data (gets a rejection for data connection);The SMF is rejecting the PDU session setup. This could happen if the requested data network name (DNN/APN) or slice is not permitted for that UE; or if the network doesn t support the requested PDU session type (IPv6 vs IPv4; etc.). It might also be due to missing default route in core for that APN,Check the reject cause for the PDU Session in the signaling trace. If it s an Unknown or missing DNN or Slice not available; update the subscriber s allowed DNN/slice list in the UDM subscription data. If it s an unsupported request (like IPv6 PDP and network only has IPv4 addresses); ensure the core and UPF support the type (enable IPv6 support if needed or configure dual-stack). Implement the necessary configuration changes and then attempt the PDU session setup again; verifying that the UE can now establish a data session successfully
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Users in the same cell have different throughput; and it s traced to differences in core handling;Possibly some users are being routed via a different slice or APN with a capped bandwidth in the core network. A provisioning inconsistency might have placed a subset of users in a restricted QoS category; causing lower throughput for them irrespective of cell conditions,Audit the provisioning of the users experiencing lower throughput. Check their subscription profile and slice/APN assignment. If they re incorrectly assigned to a restricted profile or slice; update their subscription to match the intended service level. Also verify PCF rules to ensure no unintended throttling is applied. After re-provisioning; monitor those users (or test with one of their SIMs) to see if throughput now aligns with others in the same cell under similar conditions
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G users observe that browsing and apps work; but initial connection setup (DNS lookups) are slow;The DNS server provided to 5G users might be responding slowly. It could be overloaded; or the UPF is forwarding DNS queries to a distant server. Alternatively; there might be a delay in the DNS queries passing through the core network,Check what DNS server IP is assigned to the UEs (via DHCP or NAS). Test the response time of that DNS. If high latency; consider using a more local DNS resolver or deploying a caching DNS in the core or at the UPF. Also ensure multiple DNS servers are configured for redundancy. Implement the changes by updating the DHCP options or UDM profile for UEs; then test again by resolving a common hostname from a UE to confirm quicker DNS response times
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,After a core network software upgrade; some UEs did not reconnect automatically until hours later or after a reboot;Stale context issue: The upgrade might have reset or lost the context of those UEs without notifying them; leaving them in a limbo state. The core might think they re still connected (so it doesn t page them) while the UE thinks it s detached (or vice versa). This mismatch prevents immediate reconnection,On noticing the issue; perform a forced detach for the affected UEs from the core side (purge their old sessions in AMF/SMF) so that they are free to reconnect. Alternatively; instruct those users to toggle airplane mode or reboot to trigger a fresh registration. For future upgrades; use a make-before-break strategy or send detach messages to UEs before shutting down to avoid this scenario. Monitor the network post-upgrade to ensure all UEs reconnect properly and no one is left stranded
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G standalone UEs are unable to perform fallback to 4G for voice calls; resulting in call failure (and maybe data interruption);EPS Fallback or RAT fallback for voice (from 5G to 4G) is not configured correctly in the core or not supported by the UE. The UE attempts to place a voice call; the network should move it to LTE (since maybe VoNR is not available); but that procedure fails; dropping the call and potentially the data session,Verify that EPS Fallback is configured in the 5G core (AMF) and that the UE s subscription allows for it. Ensure the 5G cells are broadcasting the appropriate indicators for voice fallback. If the UE doesn't support VoNR; the network should trigger a handover to LTE for the call. Configure the necessary policies and test with an affected UE by initiating a voice call. The expected outcome is the UE switches to LTE and the call succeeds. Also confirm data continuity if possible during that switch
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,vRAN: Virtualized DU process stalls due to hypervisor CPU scheduling issues;The virtualized baseband (vDU/vCU) is contending for CPU resources on the cloud host. The hypervisor may not be scheduling the real-time RAN tasks optimally; causing missed processing deadlines (e.g.; scheduling delays) which translate to latency and jitter for users,Check the resource allocation for the RAN VNFs on the hypervisor. Ensure that the vDU is configured with real-time CPU scheduling or isolated cores. If CPU contention is observed; migrate the vDU to a host with more available resources or adjust the hypervisor settings (e.g.; CPU pinning; hugepages). Monitor the latency KPI on that cell after changes to ensure the virtualization layer is no longer impacting real-time performance
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,A 5G core network function in a container keeps restarting; causing brief service interruptions;The containerized network function (e.g.; AMF or SMF) might be exceeding resource limits or encountering an exception. For instance; it could be running out of memory due to a leak; and the Kubernetes orchestration restarts the pod each time; leading to temporary service loss for attached UEs,Inspect the logs and events for the restarting container to identify the cause (memory OOM kill; crash loop; etc.). Increase the resource limits if it s resource starvation; or apply a software patch if it s a bug causing crashes. Optionally; add more instances for load sharing. Once adjustments are made; observe the stability of that network function (no more restarts) and ensure UEs remain attached without interruption
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,After an orchestrator update; some 5G cells went down or became unreachable;An automated configuration pushed by the orchestration system (SDN/NFV orchestrator) contained errors. Possibly wrong IP addresses or VLAN settings were applied to the gNodeB or core interfaces; causing loss of connectivity between RAN and core,Roll back the recent changes applied by the orchestrator to restore the last known good configuration. Manually correct any obvious errors in the config (such as reassigning the correct IPs or interface settings) and re-establish connectivity to the gNodeBs. Then; review and test the orchestrator configuration in a staging environment to fix the error before attempting the update again. Verify that all affected cells reconnect to the core and resume normal operation after the fix
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Timing synchronization issues in a virtualized environment leading to TDD slot misalignment;In a cloud RAN setup; the PTP (Precision Time Protocol) timing distribution to the vDU was not stable. The virtual environment introduced jitter in time sync; causing the gNodeB s internal clock to drift and TDD frame alignment issues; which can degrade throughput or violate regulations,Check the PTP timing logs on the virtualized RAN components. Ensure the cloud infrastructure provides hardware-assisted timestamping (SyncE or GPS) to the RAN VNFs. If the current host cannot maintain sync; migrate the RAN VNFs to a host with a stable timing source or attach a GPS receiver. After improving sync (e.g.; stabilizing PTP with proper configuration or hardware assist); monitor that the TDD alignment alarm clears and that throughput/latency metrics improve to normal levels
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Integration of a new O-RAN radio unit caused instability and errors on a 5G cell;An interoperability mismatch between the third-party O-RAN RU (Radio Unit) and the DU. Differences in software versions or misaligned configuration (like the eCPRI protocols) can lead to communication errors; resulting in retransmissions or even the cell going down,Capture logs on the DU for the fronthaul interface to the RU; looking for protocol errors. Work with the RU vendor to ensure both sides are using compatible O-RAN fronthaul profiles and software releases. Update the DU/RU firmware if needed to a harmonized version. Adjust configuration parameters (like timing advance or compression settings) per vendor recommendations. Once updated; observe the cell s performance and ensure it remains stable with the new RU in operation
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Deployment of a new network slice caused existing slice users to see performance issues;The network slice orchestration allocated network resources in a way that starved an existing slice. Possibly an error in slice resource partitioning (CPU; bandwidth) caused overall resource exhaustion or contention affecting the other slice s throughput,Review the slicing configuration on both the core and RAN. Check how resources (like PRBs or QoS scheduling weights; as well as core throughput) are partitioned. If the new slice was given too high a share or not properly isolated; re-balance the allocation to ensure no slice monopolizes resources. Implement proper isolation (e.g.; separate QoS queues) for each slice. After adjustments; monitor the performance indicators of both the new and existing slices to confirm that each is getting its intended share without impacting the other
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Auto-scaling function in the 5G core scaled down network functions; leading to capacity issues;An automated scaling policy misinterpreted a temporary low usage as a trigger to scale in (remove) core network instances; such as shutting down a UPF or AMF instance. When traffic picked up again; there was insufficient capacity; causing congestion and slow responses,Examine the auto-scaling logs and rules to determine why the scale-in was triggered. Adjust the thresholds or add a minimum instance floor to prevent scaling in below safe capacity. Immediately redeploy additional instances of the scaled-down network function to restore capacity. In the future; test the scaling policy under various traffic patterns to ensure it only scales in/out at appropriate times. Verify that after adding back resources; the core handles peak traffic without issues and no further unintended scale-in events occur
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Secure communication failure between network elements after a certificate expired;A digital certificate used for secure signaling (for example; TLS on the NG-C interface or IPsec between RAN and core) expired. As a result; gNodeBs could not establish secure connections to the core; or core NFs refused communication; causing service disruption,Identify which certificate has expired by checking logs on the affected interfaces (look for TLS handshake failures or certificate errors). Obtain or generate an updated certificate from the certificate authority. Install the new certificate on all relevant network elements (gNodeBs; core nodes) and ensure time synchronization is correct to avoid validity issues. Once updated; verify that secure connections (NG-C; Xn; etc.) can be established normally and that the network elements trust the new certificate
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,A mass configuration update introduced a network-wide performance regression;A recent bulk parameter change (for instance; enabling a new feature or altering a common setting) had an unintended side effect that negatively impacted throughput or latency across many cells. This could be due to a software bug triggered by the new setting or simply a suboptimal parameter value,Using the change management logs; pinpoint the parameter that was globally modified. Roll back that change on a few test cells to see if performance returns to normal. If yes; perform a controlled rollback network-wide to restore previous settings. If the feature is desired; engage with the vendor to understand the issue and possibly get a fix or a recommended configuration. After rollback; monitor network KPIs closely to confirm that the regression is resolved
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Throughput on a 5G gNodeB is capped due to a software license limitation;The baseband unit or core component has a license-imposed limit (for example; maximum throughput or maximum number of users); and the network has hit that cap. Additional traffic is being dropped or queued; resulting in an artificial ceiling on performance,Check the licensing status and performance counters on the suspected network element (gNodeB or UPF). If a license limit is being reached (e.g.; 10 Gbps throughput license cap); procure and apply a license upgrade from the vendor to increase the limit. Alternatively; redistribute load to other elements if possible. After applying the new license; monitor the element to ensure it can now handle increased throughput and verify that users in the area experience higher data rates
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Signaling storm from misbehaving device causes one cell s control-plane to overload;A malicious or malfunctioning device is repeatedly attempting to access the network; causing a signaling storm. For example; a rogue UE might be continuously sending random access requests or attach attempts; overloading the cell s RACH and signaling capacity,Use the network s UE logging and intrusion detection systems to identify the source (IMSI or temporary ID) of the excessive attempts. Once identified; block or quarantine that device at the network level (e.g.; in the core or via RAN access control lists). Implement rate limiting on RACH or attach attempts to protect the cell. After mitigating; observe the cell s signaling load returning to normal and verify legitimate users can connect without issues
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G users experience very slow internet because the network s data path is being saturated by junk traffic;A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is targeting the mobile network s data gateway (UPF) or the internet uplink. The attacker is generating a flood of data (possibly to many UE IP addresses or to the network s public IP) causing congestion that leaves little capacity for normal user traffic,Activate DDoS mitigation measures at the network perimeter and UPF. This can include traffic filtering or rate-limiting for suspicious flows (e.g.; drop obviously malicious packets; enable anomaly detection on the UPF). Coordinate with upstream providers if needed to block attack traffic. Once filters are in place; monitor the throughput and ensure that legitimate user traffic speeds improve back to normal levels
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Some users report their phones show a 5G signal but no service; and the network logs show connections to an unknown cell ID;A rogue base station (fake 5G cell) is broadcasting in the area. This illegitimate cell could be luring devices to camp on it (perhaps as an IMSI catcher); which then results in no real service and prevents them from using the actual network. It might also be causing interference on the legitimate network s frequency,Perform a spectrum and cell analysis in the reported area using field test equipment to identify unauthorized 5G broadcasts. Once the rogue cell is identified (different cell ID or unauthorized frequency); work with authorities to shut it down. Strengthen network authentication (e.g.; require UE authentication of network where possible) to prevent rogue cell influence. After removal; ensure affected UEs reconnect to the legitimate network and that service is restored
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Multiple 5G sites simultaneously raised sync alarms and saw performance drop due to timing issues;A GPS jamming or interference incident. If many base stations rely on GPS for timing; a strong GPS interference (jammer) in the area can disrupt their sync; leading to TDD frame misalignment and degraded service or even shutdown (if they go into holdover mode),Investigate the geographic pattern of the sync loss. Use spectrum analyzers tuned to GPS frequency to detect jamming signals. Once identified; neutralize the source of interference (via law enforcement if malicious). Meanwhile; switch affected sites to an alternative timing source if available (such as PTP from the network). After restoring GPS; confirm that the sites regain lock and that their performance (e.g.; latency and drop rates) returns to normal
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Core network is seeing a flood of connection setup requests on the AMF; far above normal levels; causing genuine user requests to time out;A denial-of-service attack or network misconfiguration is flooding the AMF with signaling (e.g.; repeated NAS registration attempts). This could be an attacker sending fake registration messages or a misbehaving eNodeB/gNodeB continuously re-initiating connections,Examine AMF logs to differentiate legitimate from illegitimate signaling. Deploy security rules to drop or rate-limit suspicious sources (for instance; if coming from an unexpected IP or malformed messages). Ensure that only known gNodeB addresses can send signaling to the AMF (use firewall whitelisting). The AMF might also need a capacity increase or patch if the attack exploited a vulnerability. After mitigation; verify that the signaling load is back to normal and that real user attach success rates are restored
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Large number of 5G attach failures due to authentication rejections in a short time span;A security issue such as an IMSI phishing or credential replay attack. An attacker might be trying to use guessed or stolen subscriber identities to access the network; resulting in many authentication failures. This can strain the authentication servers and cause delays even for legitimate users,Inspect the AUSF/UDM logs to see patterns in the failures (same IMSI ranges; same location; etc.). Implement stricter monitoring and possibly temporary bans for IMSIs with repeated failures. If it appears to be an attack; enable two-factor or additional authentication checks for suspicious attempts and alert the security team. Ensure the HSS/UDM is not itself overloaded by the attempts by offloading or rate-limiting auth requests. Once handled; confirm that legitimate subscribers can authenticate quickly and that the burst of failures subsides
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,After a network maintenance window; a key security setting was changed; causing many 5G connections to drop;Human error or misconfiguration: an important parameter like encryption algorithm or integrity protection setting was inadvertently altered (for example; disabling an algorithm that many UEs use); leading to security mismatches that forced UEs off the network,Review the recent configuration changes made during maintenance; focusing on security-related settings. Identify the changed parameter (e.g.; allowed cipher suites). Immediately revert it to the previous setting to restore compatibility. If the change was intended; roll it out gradually with proper device compatibility checks. After rollback; monitor UE reconnections and stability; and implement safeguards in change procedures to catch such errors in the future
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,A targeted attack or malware on devices is generating a surge of uplink traffic on one slice; saturating it;A targeted attack or malware on devices may be causing an abnormal surge of traffic; such as a botnet of 5G-connected devices all uploading data or hitting specific servers. This flood on a particular slice (for instance; a slice used by IoT devices) overwhelms that slice s resources; impacting those services,Identify the traffic pattern (common destination or protocol) and the devices or slice involved. Use network analytics to pinpoint if a particular service or set of IPs is being targeted. Implement rate limiting or blocking for the malicious traffic profile at the UPF or firewall. In parallel; issue alerts to IoT device owners or update device firmware if they were hijacked. After mitigation; verify that slice utilization returns to normal and that legitimate traffic on that slice is no longer affected by the surge
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Some 5G cells suddenly went offline after a security certificate update was pushed network-wide;If the gNodeBs and core use certificates for mutual authentication (e.g.; O-RAN or certain vendor deployments); a faulty certificate update (wrong format or a missed root certificate in some nodes) can cause the gNodeBs to reject the core s connection or vice versa. Essentially; the security handshake fails; and the cells take themselves offline thinking the core is untrusted (or are refused by the core),Roll back the certificate update on either the gNodeB side or core side to the last working certificate. As a temporary measure; if possible; disable strict certificate validation to get sites back up (not ideal for security; but for quick service restoration). Then carefully re-introduce the certificate update: ensure all network elements have the complete certificate chain and correct time synchronization (for validity). Test on a small subset of nodes before wide deployment. Once fixed; confirm that all gNodeBs reconnect to the core without authentication errors
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Unauthorized access to the network management system allowed an intruder to alter a QoS setting; degrading service until discovered;A security breach in the OAM (Operations and Management) domain: someone gained access to the configuration system and changed QoS parameters (for example; lowering the priority of certain user traffic or slices). This act; whether malicious or accidental; caused network performance issues since traffic was no longer prioritized correctly,Immediately audit and revert the unexpected configuration changes (restore the original QoS profiles from backups). Investigate the security breach: change passwords; revoke unauthorized accounts; and patch any vulnerability used to gain access. Implement stricter access controls and monitoring on the management system (like 2-factor authentication; role-based permissions; and audit logs alerts). After restoring correct QoS settings; observe network performance to ensure it returns to normal; and keep an eye on management actions for any further anomalies
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Leaving a 5G home small cell causes a momentary data stall;The home 5G small cell (femtocell) is not integrated for seamless mobility. It might not be configured to allow X2/Xn handover to the outdoor macro cell; meaning when a user leaves its coverage; the session can t transfer and must be re-established on macro. This results in a momentary loss of connectivity,Verify if the femtocell is set up for handover. If it s a closed access node; it might only release UEs to idle. Enabling handover to macro (if supported by the equipment) would fix this; this involves setting neighbor relations between the femto and macro and ensuring security for handover. If not supported; mitigate by expanding the femto coverage a bit or educating the user that a brief drop may occur. In a network-managed small cell environment; consider software that supports make-before-break (dual connection) when leaving femto coverage. After any configuration changes; test by walking out of the femto coverage during an active session to see if it now remains uninterrupted on macro 5G or LTE
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,5G connectivity on a high-speed train is erratic; with frequent drops or reverts to 4G;High mobility challenge: standard 5G cell handover settings might not cope with very high speeds (~300 km/h). The train crosses cell areas too quickly; and if those cells are not specifically configured (or if using mid/high bands with small footprint); handovers can t complete in time. Additionally; the doppler shift and rapid signal changes at high speed can degrade link quality,Implement a high-speed mobility profile along the train route. Use lower-frequency bands (e.g.; sub-1GHz or mid-band with wide spacing) for coverage along rail lines. Configure extended handover regions (perhaps use conditional handover or early preparation of the next cell). Increase handover hysteresis to avoid ping-pong at high speed. Possibly deploy 5G relay devices on the train or special rail-focused antennas along the track. After changes; test the route by measuring continuity of 5G coverage and see if session drop count is reduced at high speeds
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,During big events (e.g.; stadium concerts); 5G speeds plummet and latency rises despite the network being 5G;Extreme cell congestion: even 5G has finite capacity; and a stadium full of users can generate more demand than the deployed infrastructure can handle. If not enough small cells or if insufficient spectrum is allocated; the cell will hit its throughput ceiling and users compete for resources; resulting in each getting only a small share (and the scheduling delays cause latency),Prepare event venues with appropriate capacity. This includes deploying additional 5G small cells (and possibly using mmWave spectrum for localized high capacity) and ensuring the backhaul is scaled up. Use features like load balancing to spread users across cells/sectors (including offload some to LTE or Wi-Fi if available). During events; temporary Cells on Wheels (COWs) can help. Also; implement robust admission control to manage latency (maybe limiting video quality or heavy use temporarily). Monitor network performance in real-time during the event and afterward analyze if further upgrades are needed for future events
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,After a software upgrade; some 5G gNodeBs had trouble communicating with the core until they were rebooted;Version mismatch or stale state: The gNodeBs got new software that perhaps was out-of-sync with core network versions; leading to NG interface message failures. Alternatively; the upgrade left some stale state (like security associations) that a simple reboot cleared. During this period; the cells were not fully attached to the core; affecting user service,Immediately reboot or reset the affected gNodeBs to restore connectivity (which appears to have resolved the issue). For a long-term fix; coordinate software versions by either upgrading the core side to match or rolling back gNodeB software if it s incompatible. Work with the vendor to identify the protocol discrepancy and patch it. In future upgrades; perform interoperability testing in a lab with the core version beforehand. Verify post-reboot that all gNodeBs successfully establish NGAP with the core and that UEs can attach normally
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Downlink throughput suddenly dropped due to an increase in radio retransmissions (HARQ) on a cell after a configuration change;A new link adaptation parameter or transmission mode was configured (for example; enabling a new MIMO layer or changing the target error rate) and it wasn t optimal. The cell started choosing too high a modulation/coding for the conditions; causing many transport blocks to error out and require HARQ retransmission. The added retransmissions filled the subframes; effectively reducing net throughput,Roll back the recent radio parameter change that affected link adaptation or MIMO. Observe if HARQ failure rate returns to normal. If the feature is beneficial when tuned right; test different configurations in a controlled manner or on a single cell. Adjust the target BLER or the SNR thresholds for switching modulation. The aim is to find a balance where HARQ retransmissions are minimal. After adjustments; monitor the cell s BLER and throughput to confirm that the retransmission rate is low and the throughput is improved
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,A new AR/VR edge computing app stopped working because the local MEC server went offline; and traffic wasn t rerouted to the cloud;The MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) setup for that application had no high availability or fallback. When the local server failed; the network still tried to send traffic to it (via local breakout at the UPF); resulting in a blackhole. Because policies were set to prefer local breakout; the traffic never reached the central server as a backup,Detect MEC application/server failures via health checks. Update the routing policy so that if the local edge server is unreachable; traffic automatically falls back to a central cloud server. This might involve configuring the UPF to redirect to core data network upon MEC failure or having the application servers coordinate. In this instance; manually redirect traffic to the central site as a quick fix; then restore the MEC server. For long term; build redundancy for MEC and test that UEs can still use the app even if one edge node goes down; albeit with slightly higher latency
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,The network s automated alarm floods occasionally cause control-plane hiccups;When a large number of alarms or events trigger at once (for example; during a storm many sites report issues); the OAM system can flood the control network with notifications. In some architectures; this shares bandwidth or CPU with signaling; so a storm of OAM messages can ever-so-slightly delay actual user signaling; causing small hiccups or slower handovers,Segregate the OAM traffic from the signaling as much as possible (separate VLANs/QoS classes). Tune the alarm reporting rate or batching so that even in a mass outage scenario; the core focus remains on serving users. In this case; while the hiccups were minor; it's a hint to review network management traffic patterns. Implementing rate limits for non-essential messaging during crises can help. After adjustments; simulate a burst of alarms (if feasible) to ensure user-plane and control-plane traffic remain stable and unaffected by the management load
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Upon decommissioning some legacy 4G cells; 5G performance in that area degraded instead of improving as expected;Those 4G cells were actually anchoring NSA connections and carrying non-standalone control-plane traffic. Removing them left a gap where remaining 5G cells had no LTE anchor for NSA; forcing devices either to connect to farther LTE anchors (with worse performance) or drop to standalone 5G which the network might not fully support in that area. It may also be that the 4G removal changed the RF environment (less interference noise for LTE which was helping?) but that s unlikely; the main issue is NSA dependency,Ensure when phasing out LTE in an area that either 5G SA is fully available and devices are using it; or maintain some LTE anchor coverage for NSA devices. In this scenario; consider quickly filling the gap by enabling SA 5G on those cells or deploying a low-band 5G carrier to handle coverage. Also update device configuration via NAS signaling to prefer SA if NSA anchor is gone. After adjustments; test UEs in that area to see if they can attach and maintain performance on 5G (whether via SA mode or a more distant but still sufficient LTE anchor)
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Some 5G IoT devices (like security cameras) show connectivity but their data isn t reaching the server due to a mis-provisioned APN;The APN these IoT devices use might be incorrectly set up in the core routing. They attach and get IPs; but their traffic is either not leaving the mobile network or is being dropped by a firewall because the APN was supposed to be restricted/tunneled. Possibly the APN was meant to route to a private enterprise network but lacks the proper tunnel or connection; resulting in no path to the public internet or the intended server,Inspect the APN (DNN) configuration for the IoT devices in the SMF/UPF. Determine where the traffic is intended to go (enterprise VPN; internet; etc.). If it s supposed to go to a corporate network; set up the required GRE/IPSec tunnel or APN routing to that network. If it should go to internet; ensure it s not mistakenly classified as a closed/private APN. Also verify any firewall rules associated with that APN. After fixing the provisioning and network route; test connectivity from an IoT device  it should be able to send data to its server and receive responses normally
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Continuous ping tests indicate a periodic spike in latency exactly every 10 minutes on 5G; on an otherwise idle connection;This periodicity suggests a scheduled network routine  perhaps a paging cycle or system info broadcast; or even a background self-optimization task. Every 10 minutes; resources might be briefly diverted (e.g.; the cell might broadcast SIB or measure neighboring cells); causing a momentary increase in latency for ongoing data. Another possibility is a periodic context refresh in core (like security key update interval) that momentarily impacts the flow,Correlate the timing with network logs. Check if; for instance; system information is being updated on that schedule (maybe overly frequent). If a periodic measurement gap is scheduled too often; consider reducing its frequency if not needed. Also see if NAS security rekeying is set to 10 minutes; if so; perhaps extend it to reduce frequency of interruption. After any changes; run the ping test again to see if the 10-minute spike has been smoothed out or significantly reduced. The goal is to eliminate unnecessary periodic tasks that disrupt user plane if possible
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,A bug in the network slicing orchestration caused some users to be assigned to the wrong slice; limiting their connectivity;The provisioning system mistakenly tagged certain subscribers or application flows with an incorrect slice ID (S-NSSAI). As a result; they were routed into a slice that might not have access to the internet or the services they need (for example; a slice meant for a private enterprise). This misrouting can restrict or isolate their traffic; giving the impression of network issues,Audit the subscriber profiles and the slice assignment logic in the NSSF/UDM. Identify the mis-tagged users (maybe by tracking complaints or unusual slice usage logs). Correct their slice identifiers in the provisioning database and trigger an update (or have them reconnect). Also fix the orchestration rule that made the mistake; to prevent new misassignments. After correction; monitor those users  connectivity  they should now be on the proper public slice and have normal access. Additionally; implement a sanity check in the slice controller to catch anomalies like consumer IMSIs showing up in enterprise slices
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Interference from 5G to satellite services was reported in C-Band; causing a regulatory concern and forced power reduction;In some regions; mid-band 5G (around 3.5 GHz) can potentially interfere with satellite downlink (like C-band satellite TV). If tower emissions leaked into the satellite band or overloaded nearby satellite receivers; complaints could arise. The network may have had to reduce power on certain frequencies to mitigate this; which in turn reduces 5G coverage/throughput in those cells,Conduct joint testing with the satellite service representatives. Ensure all 5G transmitters are within their spectral masks and not exceeding power toward horizon (satellite dish elevation). If interference persists; install filters on the satellite receivers or create a small guard band at the band edge. Temporarily; the network might lower power on the affected frequencies as done. After mitigation (filters on satellite or tuning 5G); gradually bring 5G power back up if allowed and observe if any interference reports recur. Maintain compliance with any regulatory mandates in that spectrum to avoid service restrictions
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,A miscommunication between two overlapping 5G networks (multi-operator scenario) caused user devices to frequently switch networks or lose service;In some areas; two operators might share infrastructure or have overlapping coverage. If a device is allowed (e.g.; via eSIM or roaming agreement) to access both; it might oscillate if not properly controlled. Or possibly one network s signals were mistakenly identified as the other s due to identical IDs (MCC/MNC confusion in a shared RAN scenario). This resulted in devices trying to authenticate on the 'wrong' core and failing,Clarify and correct the network broadcasting IDs and access agreements in that area. If this is a MOCN (Multi-Operator Core Network) sharing scenario; ensure each cell broadcasts the correct PLMN IDs and that each device knows which one to prefer. If devices were bouncing due to roaming settings; update their SIM provisioning to favor the home network. Also; coordinate with the other operator to adjust signal power balance if one network s coverage bleeds too much into the other s territory. After fixes; test with devices to confirm they stick to the intended network and don t see unexpected service drops or switches

Likely cause is an issue in the inter-site SMF failover process or data replication latency. Improvement is needed in the failover design. Optimize data replication across sites and verify procedures for transferring control without losing sessions.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF active-standby switch triggers unexpected behavior. An automated SMF failover occurred after a heartbeat was missed. The standby took over. Some users experienced unusual session behavior like brief data stalls.,The failover mechanism worked but not perfectly smoothly. The cause may be a slight delay or race condition in the takeover. Fine-tune the heartbeat and takeover thresholds. Update the SMF software if there is a known bug causing issues on failover. Additional testing can validate the stability of the failover mechanism.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF session count threshold alarm triggered under load. The number of active sessions approached a high threshold during a busy period. This triggered an alarm. Service continued without an outage.,The alarm indicates the system is nearing its capacity limit. There is no immediate failure but it serves as a warning. The recommended action is to consider increasing capacity or adjusting the threshold. Continue to monitor session counts to ensure the SMF can handle projected loads.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF memory usage alert with no service impact. A memory utilization alarm for SMF was raised when usage spiked but it went back down shortly after. Users did not notice any issue.,This was likely a false alarm or momentary peak. It had no effect on service. The advice is to verify memory usage patterns and possibly raise the alert threshold if it is set too low. Additionally optimize memory usage if these spikes happen often.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF CPU high utilization alarm auto-cleared. SMF CPU usage briefly exceeded a threshold and triggered an alarm. The utilization dropped before any manual action could be taken and the alarm cleared itself.,This incident suggests the threshold might have been set too low or the spike was very temporary. No immediate action is required other than verifying that the CPU usage returned to normal. Adjust the threshold or continue to monitor CPU patterns to ensure this is not a sign of a developing problem.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF response time KPI slightly degraded without user impact. Performance metrics show SMF response time increased slightly above target during a short interval. No user complaints were reported and service remained stable.,This KPI deviation could be due to a transient condition. There is no direct impact. It is worth noting and keeping under observation. Fine-tuning performance parameters or investigating any events during that interval might provide insights to maintain optimal response times.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF not sending usage reports to charging system. The post call billing data is not being updated. The charging function shows no usage records coming from the SMF. Sessions are running normally.,Likely cause is a fault in the interface between the SMF and the charging system. The SMF might have a misconfiguration or connection issue preventing usage data transfer. Check the charging interface configuration on the SMF and ensure connectivity. Then re-establish the reporting to the billing system.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,billing record generation issue in SMF with no user impact. The billing system reports some missing usage records from SMF. Users are not affected in real time but the missing records could cause incomplete billing for some sessions.,The cause is possibly a software bug or timing issue in usage data generation. You should verify the SMF CDR and usage report logs. Ensure the records are queued and sent correctly. A software patch might be needed to fix the record generation bug. There is no immediate service impact.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF system clock offset triggers synchronization warning. Network management raised a time synchronization warning for the SMF node. The SMF clock was a few minutes off from the standard time source. Services ran normally.,This likely resulted from an NTP synchronization issue or a misconfigured time server. The fix is to resync the SMF system clock with the network time protocol source. Ensuring consistent time sync will prevent potential issues with time-dependent processes or logs.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,duplicate session context causing errors on user reconnect. A user reconnects quickly after a drop and the SMF logs show an error about an existing session entry. The user then has difficulty reconnecting immediately due to this error.,Likely cause is that the previous session was not fully cleared from the SMF. This leads to a conflict. Troubleshoot by examining SMF session release procedures and timers. Adjust the configuration to release or reuse session IDs faster. Apply patches if available to handle rapid reconnect scenarios properly.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,misconfigured DNS server address in SMF affecting connectivity. Users obtain an IP address but cannot reach any websites or services. Investigation reveals that the DNS server address provided to UEs via SMF is incorrect.,The cause is a configuration error in the DNS settings on the SMF or in the subscriber data. Update the SMF configuration or the subscriber profile with the correct DNS server addresses. New sessions will receive the proper DNS information once the configuration is corrected. This will restore normal connectivity.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,uneven load distribution across SMF instances causing overload. In a multi-SMF deployment one SMF instance is handling far more session requests than others. That instance becomes overloaded while the others are underutilized.,Likely cause is an issue with load balancing or SMF selection by the network possibly due to a configuration bias in the AMF or NRF. The solution is to adjust the SMF selection algorithm or registration weights so that traffic is evenly spread. Each SMF will carry an appropriate share of the load after rebalancing.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF internal state inconsistency leads to unpredictable behavior. After a certain event the SMF internal state or database became inconsistent. Some sessions are stuck or behaving oddly. Errors appear when managing those sessions.,Possible cause is a software bug causing internal data corruption possibly triggered by an abnormal shutdown or an edge case event. The SMF may need a restart to clear the inconsistent state. Also analyze logs to identify what led to the corruption and apply vendor fixes or configuration changes to prevent recurrence.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF license limit reached causing capacity outage. The SMF has reached the maximum number of sessions allowed by its license. Any new user attempting to establish a session is denied and this effectively halts new connections.,This is a capacity issue caused by a license cap. The immediate step is to contact the vendor to extend the license or apply a temporary key if available. Also manage the current sessions and possibly release any inactive sessions. Ensure the license capacity is sufficient for peak demand to avoid such hard cutoffs in the future.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF configured with wrong endpoint for subscriber data service. SMF is failing to retrieve subscriber information because it is querying the wrong address. The network database (UDM) is running but SMF is not reaching it due to the misconfiguration.,The cause is a misconfigured endpoint or address for the UDM in the SMF settings. Update the SMF configuration to point to the correct UDM service address and credentials. Verify connectivity and that SMF can successfully query subscriber profiles after the correction.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,4G to 5G handover to SA core fails at SMF stage. Users on LTE (4G) attempt to hand over to the 5G Standalone core. The data session setup in 5G fails. The handover aborts and the users fall back to 4G.,Likely cause is an interworking configuration issue or an incompatible session context transfer to the 5G SMF. The SMF might not accept the incoming session request due to a missing mapping of 4G parameters such as APN to DNN or other profile mismatches. Troubleshoot by checking the N26 interface settings on the SMF. Ensure the 4G context is properly translated for 5G. Adjust the configuration or apply updates to allow a seamless handover.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,recurring error message in SMF logs with no impact. The SMF logs show a specific error message appearing repeatedly. It occurs roughly every hour. There is no corresponding issue in service observed for users.,This is likely a benign software bug that triggers an error log without affecting functionality. The recommended step is to report it to the vendor for correction in a future update. It can be monitored in the short term and does not require immediate action since it does not impact users.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF debug mode left enabled causing high log volume. Debug logging remained on for SMF after a troubleshooting session. The system continues to function normally but it is generating an unusually high volume of log data.,The cause is simply that a verbose logging setting was not turned off. This can fill up disk space or slightly affect performance if left unchecked. The solution is to disable debug logging and revert to normal logging levels. Housekeeping can be done to clear out excessive log files.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF statistics reporting discrepancy in monitoring tools. Network monitoring tools show static or incorrect session counts for the SMF but the actual sessions on the network are fine.,This is likely due to a fault in the SMF statistics reporting functionality or an issue in its interface to the monitoring system. The service itself is unaffected. To fix this you might reset the SMF stats counters or reconnect the monitoring feed. Apply a software patch if available to correct the reporting error so that monitoring reflects accurate information.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF software bug triggers repeated crashes under specific condition. The SMF crashes and restarts whenever a certain rare event occurs. For example a specific message sequence from a UE can trigger this failure. This has happened multiple times and caused intermittent outages.,This is due to a severe software bug in the SMF that is reproducibly triggered by that event. The immediate action is to avoid the triggering scenario if possible and work with the vendor for an urgent fix. A patch or update is required to resolve the bug. Increase monitoring and prepare a contingency plan for quick SMF restarts until a fix is available to mitigate the impact.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SMF certificate expiration causes core communication breakdown. The SMF security certificate expired. As a result other core network functions are refusing connections. No new sessions can be established and some control-plane interactions are failing.,The cause is the expiration of the SMF certificate used for secure communication. This issue requires installing a valid certificate on the SMF and updating the trust relationships. Normal secure communication will resume once the certificate is renewed and distributed. Implement proactive certificate management to prevent future expirations from going unnoticed.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF node experiences a complete service outage leading to a total loss of 5G data connectivity for all users in the network. All 5G UEs in the network are unable to attach or use data services. The gNB indicates no response from the AMF on the N2 interface. NAS registration attempts from UEs do not receive any reply from the core.,The root cause is an AMF software crash causing a full outage. Troubleshooting involves immediate restart of the AMF node and checking core network alarms. Log analysis revealed a memory leak leading to the crash. After applying a software patch to fix the memory leak; the AMF was stabilized and normal data service resumed.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF loses connectivity with all gNodeBs due to SCTP link failure resulting in a network wide data service disruption. Every connected gNodeB reports lost association with the AMF. No NGAP messages are observed in the AMF during the outage. UEs cannot complete registration or maintain existing sessions.,Root cause was an SCTP connection failure between gNodeBs and the AMF. Network checks found a misconfigured IP route on the AMF that dropped SCTP traffic. The resolution involved correcting the IP routing configuration and re-establishing the SCTP associations. Once fixed; NGAP signaling resumed and data services were restored.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF fails to forward PDU session establishment requests to the SMF preventing UEs from establishing new data sessions. UEs successfully register with the network but cannot establish data sessions. The AMF receives PDU session establishment NAS requests but the SMF does not receive any session create request. AMF logs show repeated NAS requests with no corresponding N11 messaging to the SMF.,Root cause is a bug in the AMF software that halted N11 interface messages. The AMF was not sending PDU session create messages to the SMF due to a process error. Troubleshooting included analyzing AMF logs and observing that NAS requests were not followed by N11 interactions. A software fix was applied to the AMF to correct the process handling; and after restarting the AMF node UEs were able to establish data sessions normally.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF not retrieving subscriber data from UDM leading to failed service authorization for 5G data sessions. Newly attaching UEs are stuck in limited service state. The registration seems to proceed; but when establishing a data session the network fails to authorize the service. AMF logs indicate missing subscription data during the session setup procedure.,The AMF could not retrieve subscriber profile information from the UDM due to a connection outage. The root cause was a UDM interface failure. The fix required restoring connectivity to the UDM and ensuring the UDM is responsive. After re-establishing the AMF-UDM link; subscription data was properly retrieved and UEs could complete data session setup.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Authentication failures at the AMF causing all new 5G data sessions to be rejected. All new UEs are failing to register or establish data sessions. The AMF shows multiple authentication rejects. NAS messages indicate that the authentication procedure cannot complete. None of the UEs are obtaining 5G service.,The root cause was an AMF configuration error with the AUSF credentials. The AMF was using an incorrect key for authentication causing every authentication attempt to fail. Troubleshooting involved verifying the AUSF connection and credentials in the AMF configuration. After correcting the authentication key and restarting the authentication service on the AMF; UEs were able to authenticate successfully and obtain data connectivity.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF experiences CPU overload resulting in widespread latency and data session setup failures. During a sudden surge of network traffic; the AMF becomes unresponsive. Many UEs experience timeouts during registration and PDU session establishment. The network monitoring shows the AMF CPU at maximum utilization; NAS and NGAP message handling is severely delayed.,The root cause was CPU overload on the AMF due to an unexpected signaling storm. To resolve this; non-logging was temporarily disabled to reduce load and additional AMF instances were brought online to share the load. Operators also implemented rate limiting on incoming NAS requests to stabilize the AMF. After these actions; the AMF responsiveness returned to normal and UEs could register and establish data sessions again.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF fails to allocate correct network slice causing UEs to be unable to obtain data service on their intended slice. UEs attempting to connect to a specific network slice cannot get a data session. The registration completes but the PDU session for that slice fails. AMF logs show that no appropriate slice (S-NSSAI) was assigned to the PDU session request. Many UEs are left without data connectivity on that slice.,Root cause was a misconfiguration of network slice parameters in the AMF. The slice was not properly configured or mapped to an SMF; so slice-specific session requests were failing. The resolution involved updating the AMF configuration with the correct S-NSSAI mapping to an available SMF. After reconfiguring and syncing the slice information; UEs successfully established data sessions on the intended slice.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Complete failure of AMF node cluster resulting in an entire region losing 5G data connectivity. A cluster of AMF nodes responsible for a region went down simultaneously. All UEs in that region lost registration and data connectivity. There were no control plane responses from the AMF cluster for any incoming requests. The core network signaled a alarm for AMF availability.,The AMF cluster failure was due to a synchronization issue that caused a crash across all nodes after a configuration update. Troubleshooting involved rolling back the recent update and sequentially restarting each AMF node in the cluster. Additionally; logs were reviewed to pinpoint the configuration error. Once the cluster was restored and the faulty configuration corrected; UEs in the region re-registered and data connectivity was restored.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF fails to handle encryption algorithm negotiation causing incompatible security settings and blocking data sessions. UEs are getting registered but are immediately dropping off when trying to use data. The security mode command process is failing for all UEs. AMF logs reveal that the encryption algorithm agreed with the UE is not supported by the user plane; causing the session to not proceed.,The root cause was an inconsistency in configured encryption algorithms between the AMF (and core) and the UEs. Specifically; the network allowed an algorithm that the user plane could not support. The resolution required updating the AMF allowed cipher list to exclude the unsupported algorithm. After updating the security settings on the AMF and reinitializing security mode procedures; UEs stayed connected and data sessions resumed normally.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,outage of N11 interface between AMF and SMF blocking all 5G data session establishment in the network. All attempts to create new PDU sessions are failing across the network. UEs complete registration but cannot get an IP address for data. The SMF does not receive any session establishment requests from the AMF. AMF logs show repeated unsuccessful attempts to send messages over the N11 interface.,The N11 interface (AMF-SMF communication) was down due to a failed software update on the SMF. The root cause was a version incompatibility causing message handshake failure. Troubleshooting included reviewing interface logs and attempting a manual session setup trace. The fix involved rolling back the SMF update to restore compatibility with the AMF. Once N11 signaling was restored; UEs were able to establish data sessions again.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Frequent SCTP resets on N2 interface causing intermittent data session drops and service degradation. The connection between gNodeB and AMF keeps resetting periodically. UEs occasionally get disconnected or experience data session drops; especially when the SCTP reset occurs. NGAP logs from the gNodeB show repeated SCTP re-establishment procedures throughout the day.,The cause of the issue was network instability leading to SCTP heartbeat failures. The resolution steps included checking physical link quality and reducing SCTP heartbeat interval sensitivity on both AMF and gNB to tolerate brief outages. After adjusting network link stability and SCTP parameters; the frequency of resets decreased and the data sessions stabilized.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Partial failure in AMF to SMF communication leading to some UEs being unable to establish data sessions. Some UEs can register and use data normally; while others cannot establish data sessions. The failing UEs are associated with a specific data network name (DNN). AMF logs show that session requests for that DNN are not answered by any SMF. Other DNNs are working fine.,This issue was caused by a misconfiguration where a particular DNN was not mapped to an available SMF on the AMF. Troubleshooting involved verifying the DNN to SMF configuration on the AMF. Engineers updated the configuration to include the missing DNN mapping and reloaded the configuration. Following the fix; UEs using that DNN were able to establish data sessions successfully.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF fails to assign a temporary ID properly causing UEs to lose connectivity when moving to idle state. UEs can initially use data services; but after going idle and then attempting to resume (paging) they fail to re-establish the data connection. The AMF logs show unusual entries where the UE context cannot be found for paging. NAS messages for service request are not being handled for these UEs.,The root cause was an issue in the AMF handling of temporary identifiers (like 5G-GUTI assignments). When UEs transitioned to idle; the identifier was not properly stored; making the AMF unable to page them. Troubleshooting steps included analyzing the paging procedure logs and verifying the GUTI allocation mechanism. The solution involved applying a patch to fix the GUTI allocation bug. Once applied; UEs could successfully resume data sessions after idle mode.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Excessive NAS signaling from a faulty UE causing AMF performance issues and data delays for other UEs. One misbehaving UE continuously sends registration requests and other NAS messages. The AMF becomes busy dealing with this single UE; leading to slower response times for others. Other UEs see delays in PDU session setup and occasional timeouts. AMF logs are flooded with repeat messages from the same UE.,This was a denial-of-service type scenario caused by a faulty or malicious UE. The AMF was saturated with repetitive NAS signaling. The immediate step was to blacklist the offending UE identity at the AMF to stop processing its requests. Network monitoring and NAS logs were used to identify the UE. After filtering out the UE; the AMF load normalized and data session setup times for other users returned to normal.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF node interface IP changed unexpectedly leading to gNodeB not being able to connect; impacting data services. The gNodeB suddenly cannot reach the AMF. UEs under that gNodeB lose data connectivity. Investigation shows the AMF N2 interface IP is not matching what the gNodeB is configured to use. NGAP setup messages are failing as a result.,The root cause was an unintended IP address change on the AMF N2 interface. The gNB was still trying the old IP; causing a connection failure. The resolution involved updating the gNB configuration with the new AMF IP (or reverting the AMF IP change). Once the IP mismatch was resolved and the SCTP associations re-established; the gNB successfully connected and data services were restored for its UEs.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Faulty timer configuration on AMF causing premature session releases and data interruptions. Some UEs experience unexpected drops in their data sessions shortly after establishing them. It appears the network is releasing connections too early. AMF logs reveal that a session release procedure is being triggered after a fixed short interval; affecting multiple UEs.,The issue stemmed from an incorrectly configured timer on the AMF for the active data session (possibly an idle or inactivity timer). The timer was set too aggressively short. Troubleshooting involved reviewing timer settings in the AMF configuration. The fix was to adjust the timer to the correct value as per standards. After updating the configuration and restarting the AMF to apply changes; UEs no longer experienced premature session releases.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF fails to update SMF on user plane changes leading to stale paths and data session hiccups after handover. After a handover between gNodeBs; some UEs experience a brief loss of data connectivity. In these cases; the data path was not updated promptly. The SMF logs show that it did not receive the handover notification from the AMF in time; leading to a delay in user plane path switch.,The cause was an AMF signaling delay in informing the SMF of the new gNB for the UE after handover. The resolution was to check the AMF event notification settings and timers for the N2 handover procedure. By tuning the handover signaling timer and ensuring the AMF quickly sends the N2 relocation complete message to the SMF; the delay was eliminated. Subsequent handovers did not result in data path issues.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF memory leak issue causing gradual degradation of data session handling and eventual partial outages. The AMF performs normally after a fresh restart; but over time it starts to slow down. UEs increasingly see delays in registration and session setup. Eventually the AMF stops responding to some requests; causing a partial outage for data services. Memory usage on the AMF is observed to grow continuously.,The problem was a memory leak in the AMF software. Over time it exhausted resources; leading to degraded performance. Troubleshooting included monitoring memory over time and analyzing core dumps. The short-term solution was to perform controlled restarts of the AMF at off-peak times to restore service. The long-term resolution involved applying a vendor patch to fix the memory leak. After the patch; the AMF could handle prolonged operation without degradation.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,One gNodeB not configured in the AMF allowed list causing all UEs under that gNodeB to have no data service. UEs from a particular cell site are not able to register or use data; while others in the network are fine. The gNodeB is new and shows that it cannot complete the NGAP setup with the AMF. The AMF logs show an unknown gNodeB trying to connect which is being rejected.,The issue was that the new gNodeB was not added to the AMF configuration; so the AMF rejected its connection. To fix this; the network team added the gNodeB details (such as its identifier and IP info) to the AMF allowed configuration and then reinitialized the connection. After updating the AMF with the new site information; the gNodeB successfully connected and its UEs could register and access data services.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Misconfigured quality of service parameters leading to some UEs experiencing reduced data throughput. Not all UEs are affected; but those on a certain plan or slice see very low data rates. The core network is up and sessions are established; but throughput is throttled unexpectedly. AMF logs show that for those UEs the assigned QoS values are incorrect; causing the network to limit bandwidth.,The cause was a misconfiguration of QoS profiles in the AMF or SMF for that particular subscriber group. The AMF was associating the wrong QoS profile for those UEs due to a configuration mix-up. Troubleshooting involved verifying the subscription data and QoS settings in UDM and the corresponding configuration in the AMF and SMF. The team corrected the QoS configuration to match the intended profiles. Once updated; the affected UEs saw normal data throughput.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Incompatible NAS protocol extension used by UEs causing AMF to drop messages and some UEs failing to get data service. A specific model of 5G UE cannot get data service. They appear to register; but the PDU session setup never completes. The AMF debug logs show it is dropping an unrecognized IE (Information Element) in a NAS message from those UEs. Other UEs not using this extension are unaffected.,The issue was an incompatibility with a NAS protocol extension that the AMF software did not support. As a result it ignored or rejected PDU session requests from those UEs. The resolution was to update the AMF software to a version that supports the new NAS extensions or apply a patch to handle unknown IEs gracefully. After the update; the AMF could process the messages correctly and the affected UEs were able to establish data sessions.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF instance out of sync in a multi-AMF environment resulting in inconsistent UE context and data session continuity issues. In an area served by multiple AMF instances; some UEs lose data connectivity when they move between areas. It seems their context is not found on the new AMF. Some UEs have to re-register completely; causing data session interruption. Logs indicate that context transfer between AMFs did not occur for those UEs.,The root cause was an issue in the AMF context transfer mechanism. One AMF was not properly forwarding UE context to its peer during inter-AMF mobility due to a config mismatch on the interface used for AMF-to-AMF communication. Troubleshooting involved reviewing the AMF Xn or N14 interface configuration for context transfer. The solution was to correct the configuration and test the context transfer procedure. After fixing the peer communication settings; UEs moved between AMF areas without losing their data sessions.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF cannot process downlink data notification from SMF leading to paging failures and missed downlink data for idle UEs. When downlink data arrives for idle UEs; the SMF notifies the AMF to page the UE but some UEs are not receiving pages. The SMF logs show that notifications were sent. The AMF shows no page attempts for those UEs. As a result these UEs do not get the incoming data until they reattach on their own.,The cause was a bug in the AMF paging handling. The AMF was silently dropping downlink data notification messages under certain conditions (like if the UE was in a transitional state). The troubleshooting included tracing the paging interface (N2) and verifying if the AMF initiated paging. After identifying the faulty logic; a patch was applied to the AMF software. Following the fix; the AMF reliably triggered paging for idle UEs with downlink data and they resumed receiving data promptly.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Misrouted NGAP messages due to incorrect AMF ID causing signaling confusion and data session setup delays. In the network; some signaling messages from a gNodeB were mistakenly routed to a wrong AMF instance. This caused confusion in the control plane; where a UE initial message was handled by one AMF and subsequent messages by another. The user eventually got service but only after delays and reattempts.,This was caused by an incorrect AMF identifier configured in one gNodeB causing it to sometimes send to the wrong AMF. The resolution involved correcting the AMF identifier and address in the gNodeB configuration. Network logs and the core routing tables were examined to identify the misrouting. Once the configuration was fixed; all initial UE messages consistently reached the correct AMF and data session setups became smooth without delays.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF not releasing old context causing new session setup to fail for returning UEs. UEs that had previously detached and are attempting to reattach cannot get a data session. The AMF appears to consider that the UEs already have an active session and rejects new attempts. Logs show context for those UE IDs still present and not cleared properly upon detach.,The cause was that the AMF did not fully clear UE context after detachment due to a software bug. Residual context made the AMF think the UEs were duplicates. The fix involved cleaning up stale contexts by restarting the AMF context management service and applying a patch that corrects the detach procedure. After deploying the fix; UEs were able to reattach and establish new data sessions without issues.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Signaling storm during peak hours causing delayed processing of NAS messages and data session timeouts. During peak usage; the network experiences a surge in signaling. The AMF has a backlog of NAS messages. Some UEs time out waiting for replies; leading to failed data session setups. Monitoring shows high signaling traffic and some NAS procedures taking unusually long to complete.,The AMF was experiencing congestion under heavy signaling load. The immediate mitigation was to distribute UEs to additional AMF nodes to balance the load. Operators also performed database optimization for the AMF internal procedures to handle high traffic. Additionally; unnecessary periodic update messages from UEs were configured to be less frequent to reduce load. After these measures; the AMF handled peak traffic more efficiently and session timeout issues subsided.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Incorrect APN (DNN) configuration preventing certain devices from getting a 5G data session. A group of devices using a specific APN (now called DNN in 5G) cannot establish data sessions. They register fine; but the PDU session fails immediately. Other APNs are working for the same UEs if tried. The AMF logs indicate no available session routing for the requested DNN.,The cause was a missing or incorrect configuration for that DNN on the AMF and SMF. Essentially; the network did not know how to route sessions for that APN. Troubleshooting steps involved reviewing the configured DNN list and slice configuration on the AMF. The missing configuration was added and the SMF was configured accordingly. After correcting the APN configuration and syncing it across AMF and SMF; the devices were able to establish data sessions on that APN.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF to AUSF interface issue resulting in new UEs failing to attach due to authentication not completing. New UEs attempting to attach to the network are failing at the authentication stage. The NAS authentication request is sent but never successfully completes. AMF logs suggest timeouts waiting for a response from the AUSF. Meanwhile; existing connected UEs continue unaffected.,This was caused by an interface issue between the AMF and AUSF (authentication server). The connection was mistakenly blocked by a firewall policy after a maintenance change. The troubleshooting included checking the communication path to AUSF and finding the drop. The resolution was to correct the firewall rules to allow AMF-AUSF traffic and verify connectivity. Once the interface was restored; the authentication procedures succeeded and new UEs could attach and use data.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Handover failure due to AMF not honoring a configuration update leading to dropped data sessions during inter-cell handovers. When UEs move from one cell to another; a significant number of calls drop. The handover request is initiated but fails. The gNodeB logs indicate the target cell did not receive necessary context from the AMF. The AMF had a new configuration for handover that was recently introduced.,The issue was the AMF not properly using updated handover configuration (possibly a new parameter was introduced but not fully activated). The resolution involved rolling back to the previous stable handover settings on the AMF. Engineers performed thorough testing on a staging environment to identify the mismatch. After reverting the configuration; handovers proceeded normally and data sessions were maintained across cell changes.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF misinterprets a 5G NAS message leading to session establishment errors for certain UEs. Certain UEs send a slightly different form of a NAS message during session establishment. The AMF log indicates it flags an error upon receiving those messages. These UEs fail to get an IP address for data; although others in the same area do fine. The issue is reproducible with those specific UEs or firmware version.,This problem was due to the AMF software misinterpreting an otherwise standards-compliant NAS message variant. After capturing the NAS messages and analyzing them; it was determined that the AMF NAS stack had a parsing issue. The resolution required a software update or patch from the vendor to fix the NAS parsing logic. Once the fix was applied; the previously failing UEs could establish data sessions normally.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF slow in releasing resources causing delays in new data session setup after old sessions end. After some UEs disconnect; they and others attempting new sessions face delays. It looks like the network is at capacity even though UEs left. AMF resource logs show that some session context entries remain marked as active even after disconnection. This hogs session capacity and makes new session setups wait or fail.,The cause was that the AMF was not promptly releasing session resources due to a delay in clearing contexts. The troubleshooting step was to confirm via logs and management interface that contexts were stuck. A temporary fix was to manually clear the stale contexts via management commands. The permanent fix involved a patch to ensure the AMF immediately clears session state on termination. After the fix; resource counts freed up properly and new sessions were established without delay.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Partial outage due to one AMF in cluster failing some UEs experience service interruption while others remain unaffected. The network uses multiple AMF instances. One of them failed unexpectedly due to a hardware fault. UEs connected to that particular AMF lost data service; whereas UEs on other AMFs continued normally. Monitoring shows one AMF node down and not responding to its UEs on N2 and N1.,The failure of a single AMF node caused a partial outage. The resolution steps included shifting the affected UEs to a healthy AMF by triggering a re-registration for those UEs. Engineers also replaced the faulty hardware and brought the failed AMF node back online. Improvements were identified to automate failover so that UEs automatically reconnect to a standby AMF if their serving AMF goes down.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF overloaded interface queue causing signaling messages to be dropped under high load. Under heavy load; some NAS and NGAP messages do not get processed by the AMF. This leads to missing signals such as a delay in Registration Accept or PDU session setup messages. UEs under load conditions see failures that clear up after load reduces. The AMF internal message queue is observed growing during the issue.,The AMF was dropping messages because its internal queues were overflowing under high load. The troubleshooting included monitoring internal metrics and traffic patterns. The solution involved increasing the queue capacity and optimizing the message processing threads within the AMF. Additionally; load balancing more UEs to other AMF nodes helped. After these changes; the AMF could handle high traffic without dropping signaling messages and UEs no longer experienced failures during peak load.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,NAS encryption mismatch leading to some UEs failing the security mode and dropping connection. A subset of UEs (often older models) cannot complete the security mode procedure during registration. They get rejected and cannot use data. Logs show the AMF sending a security mode command and then a failure occurring. Those UEs likely only support older encryption algorithms that the network initially did not prefer.,The issue was an encryption algorithm mismatch. The AMF was picking an algorithm not supported by those UEs. Troubleshooting involved analyzing the security capabilities exchanged during NAS signaling. The fix was to adjust the AMF security configuration to include compatibility with older algorithms. After updating the allowed algorithms on the AMF; the previously failing UEs passed the security procedure and gained access to data services.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Delayed NGAP UE Context Release causing slower cleanup of sessions and temporary resource strain. After UEs disconnect normally; the gNodeB sends a UE Context Release command to the AMF but the AMF takes longer than usual to free the context. While not directly impacting users who already disconnected; it slightly delays those resources being available for new connections. This issue is mostly noticed in logs and by monitoring system performance.,The issue was and related to a slow handling of context release at the AMF. The root cause was a small bug in the context release timer handling. The resolution was to fine-tune the context release process in the AMF software. This was done by applying a patch to improve the handling of the release message. Post patch; context release became immediate eliminating any resource strain.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,configuration mismatch in AMF paging settings leading to slightly delayed responses to downlink data triggers. Idle UEs are mostly working fine; but occasionally there is a slight delay before they respond to downlink data. Paging is happening; but the timing seems a bit off. It does not stop service; but it is not as prompt as expected. This is noticed only in detailed testing scenarios and not by end users.,This issue was due to a configuration mismatch in paging timers between the AMF and gNodeB. The values were not aligned; causing a delay. Troubleshooting involved reviewing the timer settings on both sides and logs of paging response times. The fix was to adjust the AMF paging timer to match the expected value. After synchronization of timer settings; paging response was prompt resolving the slight delays observed.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Log overflow on AMF causing negligible performance impact but triggering alarms. The AMF generates a large volume of debug logs when a certain NAS message is processed. This caused a log partition to fill up but did not directly impact data sessions. However; it triggered an alarm and could have led to issues if left unchecked.,The root cause was excessive logging for a specific event. The resolution involved changing the logging level for the verbose event on the AMF to reduce unnecessary log volume. The logs were also rotated and cleared. This prevented any potential future performance issues and cleared the alarm. Data services were not directly affected and no user impact was observed aside from the maintenance alert.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Single UE with faulty behavior causing AMF warnings no significant impact on overall data service. Logs show repeated errors. One particular UE is triggering unusual NAS messages that the AMF flags as errors. The UE still gets service after retries and other UEs are fine. This results in error logs in the AMF but no noticeable service impact. It is essentially a single-device anomaly.,This was a issue isolated to one UE. The AMF logged error messages due to that UE atypical behavior. Troubleshooting was minimal since impact was negligible: the team monitored the UE activity and advised a firmware update on the device. The resolution was to update the UE software after which it behaved normally. The AMF no longer reported errors for that UE resolving the anomaly.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,packet loss on N2 interface causing occasional retransmissions but minimal impact on data experience. Some NGAP messages require retransmission due to packet loss between the gNodeB and AMF. Users might experience a slight delay during those retransmissions; but the system recovers automatically. This is observed in monitoring tools but does not noticeably degrade user experience except for a slight increase in signaling latency.,The packet loss was likely due to transient network issues on the N2 link. Troubleshooting included checking link statistics and ensuring error correction mechanisms were in place. The solution was to monitor the link and work with the transport team to improve link reliability. Adjusting the SCTP parameters to better handle loss (like a slightly longer timeout before retransmission) also helped. The outcome was that even if occasional loss occurred it was handled gracefully maintaining service quality.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Non-urgent AMF alarm due to infrequent NAS decode error with no user impact but requires attention in logs. Rarely; the AMF logs an error decoding a NAS message from a UE. This triggers a low-severity alarm for investigation. The UE in question usually retries and succeeds; so users do not report any problem. It is a sporadic issue seen perhaps in one out of thousands of messages.,Since the issue was infrequent and did not impact service; it was treated as a bug. Engineers collected the rare NAS messages for analysis. The cause was a corner-case message format that the AMF did not fully support. As a resolution; they included this case in the next software update. Meanwhile; the alarm threshold was adjusted so that such sporadic errors did not trigger alarms unless they became frequent. The fix in the software later eliminated these decode errors entirely.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,UE location update anomalies causing hiccups in service continuity when moving between areas. On rare occasions; a UE moving between tracking areas experiences a slight delay in reestablishing its data session. The issue is noticed as a brief hiccup in connectivity. AMF logs show that the location update procedure took longer than usual for those instances; though it eventually completes.,This hiccup was due to the AMF taking extra time to update location information in one of the internal databases. Troubleshooting involved checking the tracking area update (TAU) handling and the latency in updating the context. The team optimized the database calls within the AMF to speed up the update. After this optimization; the location update occurred faster and the brief connectivity hiccups were no longer observed.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Suboptimal parameter setting for AMF load balancing resulting in uneven load but minimal impact on service. The network has multiple AMFs; but one was handling a disproportionately high number of UEs. This caused that AMF to run near capacity while others were lightly loaded. There was no immediate impact on data sessions; but there were concerns of a potential issue if load increased further. delays were occasionally observed in the busiest AMF responses.,The cause was suboptimal configuration of the load-balancing algorithm for assigning UEs to AMFs. Troubleshooting involved reviewing how UEs are assigned to each AMF and noticing the imbalance. The team fine-tuned the load balancing parameters and; if available; enabled dynamic load rebalancing features. After these changes; new UEs were distributed more evenly across AMFs. The overloaded node response times improved; eliminating the delays and reducing future risk.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Temporary AMF service process hang causing a brief pause in handling requests but self-resolves. At one instance; the AMF paused briefly (for a few seconds) in processing requests due to a background process hang. A few NAS messages queued up but were processed once the hang cleared. Some UEs might have experienced a slight delay in response during that moment; but service continued normally right after.,This was a transient glitch in the AMF where a background thread became unresponsive for a short time. The situation resolved on its own; but engineers investigated logs to ensure it was not a symptom of a bigger issue. The root cause was traced to a routine maintenance task (like stats aggregation) that took too long. The resolution was to optimize that routine to run more efficiently during off-peak times. No further action was needed as it did not recur after adjustments.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,license limit warning on AMF approaching user capacity but not yet impacting service. The AMF is licensed for a certain number of UEs and that threshold is nearly reached. A warning is raised indicating the system is nearing capacity. Current users are not affected and data sessions continue normally; but if growth continues new attachments might be refused later. This is observed in system warnings and capacity logs.,Though service is not yet impacted; the resolution involves proactive capacity management. The team plans an upgrade to increase the AMF licensed capacity. In the interim; they ensure no new large deployments connect to that AMF. Monitoring continues for any sign of actual refusal. After the license upgrade is applied; the warning clears and the AMF can handle more UEs preventing any future capacity-related issues.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Inconsistency in AMF stored subscriber info leading to a issue where some UEs needed to reattach to update their profile. A handful of UEs that changed their subscription package were still being treated under the old profile by the AMF for a short time. As a result; their data rate was not updated until they re-registered. This did not cause loss of service; just a short delay in applying new service parameters.,This issue was caused by a caching delay in the AMF retrieving updated subscriber information from the UDM. The resolution was to clear or refresh the cache on the AMF more frequently for subscriber data changes. Once the caching policy was adjusted; any subscription changes were reflected almost immediately for connected UEs removing the need for them to reattach to get updated profiles.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,mismatch in supported frequency bands causing certain UEs to connect on fallback 4G instead of 5G. Some UEs in a fringe area are not staying on 5G and revert to 4G. While not a direct fault in data service; it means those UEs do not utilize 5G data speeds in that area. The AMF logs show that these UEs often deregister from 5G after failing to find a supported band; which might indicate an AMF configuration for coverage or bands that is slightly off.,This turned out to be related to network configuration rather than an AMF fault. The band configuration broadcast (that the AMF indirectly controls via policies) was not updated for a new frequency. The fix involved updating the network band support configuration so that those UEs recognize 5G coverage properly. Once updated; the UEs remained on 5G and utilized 5G data resolving the fallback issue.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SNSSAI configuration discrepancy leading to non-warnings in AMF logs with no user impact. The AMF log contains warnings that a particular single-network slice selection assistance information (SNSSAI) value was received but not recognized. The UEs with that slice still attach using a default slice; so service continues. This only triggers a warning in logs and is likely due to a test slice value present on a few SIMs that is not configured in the network.,Engineers verified that the SNSSAI in question was not intended for production use. The resolution was simply to add a configuration on the AMF to recognize and map that test SNSSAI to a default handling or to instruct the UEs to not request it. This eliminated the warning. Since it was a non-issue with no user impact; it was resolved in a routine maintenance update by updating the slice configuration table on the AMF.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,UE deregistration procedure edge case causing a benign error message in AMF but session ends normally. When some UEs disconnect (deregister) an error is logged indicating the context was not found; even though the session was already terminated properly. There is no effect on service as it occurs when the UE is leaving anyway. It is an edge case in the deregistration sequence observed occasionally.,This glitch was due to the AMF trying to clean up a session that was already cleaned by a parallel process. Essentially; a timing issue in handling deregistration. The fix was to adjust the deregistration handling routine to better synchronize context deletion. After applying the fix in the AMF software; the error messages ceased. There was no user-facing impact and this purely improved the cleanliness of the logs and procedures.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Monitoring tool reports inconsistency in AMF metrics with no actual impact on user sessions. The operations monitoring system flagged that the AMF reported number of active sessions briefly went negative or inconsistent for a short time. This did not reflect reality and no actual sessions were impacted. It appears to be a calculation or reporting glitch on the AMF metrics interface.,This was a issue in the metrics reporting module of the AMF. Engineers cross-checked actual session counts to ensure no real issue. The resolution was to correct the metrics calculation in a software update. Applying the update fixed the inconsistency. There was never any user impact and the monitoring tool no longer reports false anomalies.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Rare race condition in AMF message handling leading to an occasional delay but auto-corrects on retry. Under a very specific sequence of events; an initial registration message and a nearly simultaneous service request collided in the AMF processing causing one of them to be delayed. The UE had to retry once which then succeeded. This happened extremely rarely and was identified during stress testing.,Through intensive log analysis; a rare race condition was identified in the AMF handling of concurrent NAS procedures. The developers provided a patch to better serialize these events. The fix was applied to ensure one procedure completes before the next begins in such scenarios. After the patch; testing showed that the collision no longer occurred. Since it was a timing issue no regular user likely noticed it; but it was resolved to strengthen system reliability.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Transient data path setup delay where initial attempt fails but second attempt succeeds resulting in a startup lag. Occasionally; a UE first attempt to establish a data session after registering might not complete but a second immediate attempt does. This results in a few extra seconds before the UE gets an IP address. Logs show that the initial PDU session resource setup timed out; possibly because the gNB did not respond in time to the AMF request.,The transient delay was likely due to a timing issue between the AMF and gNB. Troubleshooting included checking the PDU session resource setup procedure in traces. The team increased the timeout slightly on the AMF for that procedure to give the gNB more time. Additionally; they optimized gNB response performance. After these adjustments; the initial attempt succeeded consistently removing the startup lag for data sessions.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Misleading alarm due to outdated AMF neighbor config triggering a false positive fault alert with no actual user impact. An alarm was raised indicating an AMF neighbor link failure. However; all UEs and services were working normally. It turned out that a neighboring AMF reference was left in the configuration from a previous setup and was not actually in use. The system misinterpreted its absence as a fault.,The alarm was a false positive caused by stale configuration. The resolution was to clean up the AMF configuration by removing references to the non-existent neighbor. Engineers confirmed through audits that the neighbor was not needed. Once removed; the alarm cleared. There was no effect on users; but the cleanup helps prevent confusion and keeps the fault monitoring signals accurate.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,UE count threshold nearly exceeded on one AMF causing a alarm but managed by shifting some load. One AMF came close to its supported UE count threshold raising a warning. A handful of new UEs trying to attach were temporarily redirected to another AMF. Users saw no downtime; but the distribution had to be adjusted. System logs indicated that the threshold was reached and load balancing kicked in.,This capacity alarm was addressed by proactively redistributing some UEs to other AMFs in the network. The team also planned a capacity upgrade. The resolution included verifying that the load balancing function correctly moved some UEs to alleviate the load. After the shift and a scheduled addition of a new AMF instance; the UE count per AMF was well under threshold and the warning cleared. Service continuity was maintained throughout.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Non-interface statistic error where an AMF interface counter froze not affecting service but requiring a reset. The AMF management interface stopped updating one of its statistics counters (for example; the counter for N1 messages). Operations teams noticed the number stayed constant; which was clearly incorrect; but all actual signaling was working fine. It appears to be just a reporting issue in the statistics module.,This non-issue was resolved by simply restarting the statistics service of the AMF. The cause was likely a bug causing the counter to freeze. After the restart; the counter resumed updating correctly. A fix was planned in a future release to prevent the counter from freezing. This did not affect any user traffic so it remained a low priority issue that was resolved during routine maintenance.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Testing mode left enabled on AMF leading to verbose behavior with network impact. After some maintenance; the AMF was left in a special debug or testing mode inadvertently. In this mode; it responded to certain test NAS sequences more slowly (since it was collecting extra data). A few UEs experienced delays in initial attach. The mistake was caught when noticing unusual test logs in the system.,The resolution was straightforward: disable the testing mode on the AMF. The root cause was human error in forgetting to revert the AMF to normal operation mode after maintenance. Once normal mode was restored; the AMF stopped the verbose behavior and performance returned to full speed. The attach delays disappeared and the extraneous logs ceased.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF repeatedly crashes and restarts in a loop after a software update leading to periodic complete disruptions of 5G data services across the network. Following a recent software update; the AMF node is observed to crash and reboot frequently (for example; every several minutes). Each time it restarts; all UEs lose registration and data sessions drop; then some recover until the next crash. The cycle causes a continual up-and-down data service experience.,The root cause was a software bug introduced in the latest update causing an unhandled exception. Troubleshooting involved analyzing core dump files and identifying the offending update module. The immediate solution was to roll back to the previous stable software version. After rollback; the AMF stayed online without crashing. The vendor provided a patched version to address the bug which was tested and applied to permanently resolve the issue.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF security certificate expires causing it to reject or fail communication with other core network functions and resulting in network-wide attach failures. Suddenly; all new registration and PDU session setup attempts are failing. Other network functions (like SMF UDM) log that the AMF is not responding or the connection is not authenticated. Upon inspection; the AMF services show errors establishing secure connections on service-based interfaces.,The cause was an expired digital certificate used by the AMF for secure communication with core network services. The resolution required obtaining and installing an updated valid certificate on the AMF. Administrators updated the certificate and restarted the affected AMF services to re-establish trust with other network functions. Once updated; the AMF could successfully communicate and UEs were able to attach and set up data sessions again.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF license expires causing the AMF to stop accepting new registrations and data session requests across the network. The network suddenly cannot accept any new UEs for data service. Registered users remain connected for a while; but no new attachments succeed. The AMF logs indicate it has entered an unauthorized state and is dropping incoming requests. This coincides with the license expiry date.,The outage was due to the AMF software license expiring which caused it to block new sessions. The resolution was to immediately apply a renewed license to the AMF. Once the new license key was installed and the AMF software re-validated; normal operation resumed. Additionally; processes were put in place to monitor license validity and renew licenses well before expiry to prevent future occurrences.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF sends mass deregistration to all UEs due to a malfunction causing a complete drop of all 5G data sessions in the network. Without warning; all active UEs lost connectivity simultaneously. The UEs indicated they were deregistered from the network. Control plane logs showed that the AMF issued deregistration messages to all connected UEs. This happened in error and was not due to any planned operation.,The incident was traced to a malfunction in the AMF triggered by a faulty script or bug that treated all UEs as invalid. The resolution started with stopping the offending process to prevent continuous deregistration. Then; engineers had UEs reattach by resetting the AMF and broadcasting a re-registration request. A software patch was applied to remove the erroneous trigger. After these steps; UEs could register again and data sessions were re-established. Safeguards were added to prevent global deregistration commands from executing improperly.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Subscriber database corruption at UDM causing the AMF to receive invalid subscriber data and resulting in widespread data session establishment failures. Many UEs are unable to complete data session setup because subscription data retrieval fails or returns incorrect information. The AMF receives responses from the UDM that are either empty or malformed for multiple subscribers. This leads to the AMF rejecting session requests since it cannot validate service permissions.,The root cause was a corruption in the subscriber database used by the UDM which in turn gave the AMF bad data. The resolution involved restoring the subscriber database from a recent backup and resynchronizing it with the UDM. During troubleshooting; the AMF logs and UDM queries were analyzed to identify the corruption issue. After the database restore; the AMF began receiving correct subscriber profiles and UEs were able to establish data sessions normally. Additional database integrity checks were implemented to catch such issues early.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,DDoS attack floods the AMF with signaling resulting in an overload that knocks out 5G data services for many subscribers. The network experiences a sudden surge of malicious signaling traffic aimed at the AMF. NAS registration requests and other signaling from thousands of spoofed or compromised sources bombard the AMF. Legitimate UEs cannot get timely responses; leading to widespread registration failures and dropped sessions.,Facing a denial-of-service attack; immediate measures were taken to mitigate the traffic. Network firewalls were configured to block the offending source ranges and rate-limit NAS requests to the AMF. The AMF was restarted to clear the overload. Concurrently; a traffic filter was deployed to distinguish legitimate traffic from the flood. Once mitigations were in place; the AMF load decreased to normal levels and genuine users regained access. Further security enhancements were implemented including signaling storm detection and scrubbing systems to protect the AMF from future DDoS attacks.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Firewall misconfiguration blocks N2 interface traffic cutting off all gNodeBs from the AMF and causing a complete service outage. All gNodeBs in the network suddenly lost connection to the AMF over the N2 interface. This occurred right after a firewall policy update in the core network. UEs could not register or maintain connections; effectively causing a total loss of service. The gNBs showed SCTP link down alarms towards the AMF.,The problem was identified as a firewall rule that erroneously started blocking SCTP traffic on the AMF N2 port. The immediate fix was to rollback the firewall change; restoring connectivity. Troubleshooting included checking network firewall logs and configurations to pinpoint the block. After removing the offending rule; the SCTP associations were re-established successfully. All gNodeBs reconnected to the AMF and UEs were able to register again. The firewall change process was revised to include testing connectivity for interfaces in the future.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF configuration file corruption after reboot resulting in the AMF coming online with default settings and failing to serve 5G UEs. Following a routine restart of the AMF; the node failed to properly handle registrations. It seemed to have lost its configured data (like PLMN and slice configurations) and was acting as if it were a fresh install. UEs could not register and gNodeBs reported unknown network parameters. Essentially; the AMF was not recognizing the network identity and configuration.,It turned out the AMF configuration file got corrupted and it loaded with fallback default settings. The resolution was to reload a backup of the correct configuration onto the AMF. Engineers identified the issue by noticing default IDs and parameters in AMF logs. Once the backup config was applied and the AMF was restarted; it regained the correct network settings. UEs were then able to register and access data. Steps were taken to verify file system integrity and prevent future corruption such as using redundant config storage.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Timing bug triggers mass failure at a specific time causing the AMF to drop sessions due to a software error when a certain timer or counter resets. At a particular time (for instance; midnight or a counter rollover point) a significant number of UEs were suddenly disconnected. This coincided with a periodic event inside the AMF. Many UEs had to re-register after this time. The issue was repeatable at the same interval indicating a systematic timing problem.,The cause was a software bug in the AMF triggered by a timer overflow or scheduled routine that malfunctioned. Engineers used timestamped logs to correlate the failure to a specific scheduled task in the AMF. The resolution involved applying a software patch that fixed the timer handling logic. Until the patch was ready; the team staggered the AMF internal timers as a temporary workaround to avoid simultaneous impact. After the patch installation; the timed event no longer caused any session drops.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Network function discovery failure (NRF issue) leading the AMF to be unable to find core services like SMF or AUSF and causing new session failures. The AMF relies on the network repository function (NRF) to discover addresses of other network functions. During an outage of the NRF or a registration failure; the AMF could not retrieve the service endpoints for the SMF and AUSF. As a result; new attach and session setup procedures started failing because the AMF did not know where to send requests. Ongoing sessions were not immediately affected; but any new or transitioning UEs experienced service failure.,The resolution was to restore the network function discovery mechanism. Engineers quickly identified that the NRF was down due to a fault. They restarted the NRF and ensured it had the latest registry of network functions. In parallel; a temporary static configuration was loaded into the AMF to allow it to reach services without NRF. Once NRF was back up and the AMF confirmed the addresses of SMF and AUSF; normal session establishment resumed. To prevent recurrence; the team implemented a redundant NRF setup and cached NF information within the AMF for short periods.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Missing N26 interface for interworking causing 5G to 4G fallback attempts to fail and dropping data service when UEs leave 5G coverage. In areas where UEs transition from 5G SA to 4G (LTE) coverage; calls or data sessions are dropping instead of handing over. UEs cannot fall back to LTE data resulting in a loss of connectivity until they reattach via 4G separately. The AMF logs show attempts to perform inter-system handover but there is no response or coordination with any 4G core node.,It was found that the N26 interface (for 5G-4G interworking) was not configured or enabled; so the AMF could not communicate with the 4G core (MME). The resolution involved enabling and properly configuring the N26 interface on the AMF and ensuring the 4G core was prepared for interworking. Once configured; the AMF successfully coordinated with the MME allowing seamless fallback to LTE. UEs then experienced smooth data continuity when moving out of 5G coverage.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Roaming flag misconfiguration in AMF causing home subscribers to be treated as roamers and denying their data sessions inadvertently. A portion of subscribers from the home network are being denied data service because the core thinks they are roaming (and possibly not authorized). The AMF records show it marking some local IMSIs with roaming status due to an incorrect parameter. These UEs get registered but their PDU session establishment is rejected under policy.,The issue was traced to a misconfigured parameter in the AMF that tagged certain subscribers with the wrong home network identity. Troubleshooting involved reviewing the AMF PLMN and IMSI range configuration. The configuration was corrected so that those subscribers are recognized as home network users. After the change; affected UEs were able to establish data sessions normally. The team also verified all subscriber identification settings to ensure no other ranges were misclassified.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Tracking area code not recognized by AMF leading to UEs in a certain area being unable to register for data service. UEs in one geographical area consistently fail to register on 5G. The gNodeB in that area is broadcasting a tracking area code that the AMF does not have configured. As a result when UEs from that area attempt registration; the AMF rejects them because it sees an unknown tracking area identifier.,The root cause was that the tracking area code (TAC) for that region was missing in the AMF configuration. The resolution was to update the AMF allowed tracking area list to include the missing TAC. After updating and syncing the configuration; the AMF recognized the area and UEs from that region could register and receive data service. This fix restored connectivity for users in that area and the network team double-checked all configured TACs to prevent similar issues elsewhere.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,UDM response delays causing slow or timed-out registration and session setup for some UEs. At times; UEs are experiencing very slow attach procedures or even failures. The AMF logs show that it is waiting unusually long for subscriber data from the UDM. Some requests time out; causing the AMF to drop the registration or session setup. This tends to happen during peak hours when many queries are being sent to the UDM.,The issue was identified as latency in the UDM response. It was overloaded and responding slowly. As an immediate workaround; the time-out values in the AMF were slightly increased to accommodate the delay reducing the drop rate. The longer-term fix was to optimize and upgrade the UDM to handle more queries. After the UDM improvements and configuration of additional UDM instances; the AMF received subscriber data more promptly and UEs no longer faced registration timeouts.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Bug with multiple PDU sessions per UE causing one session to drop when a second session is released for the same UE. UEs that establish two concurrent data sessions (for example one for general internet and one for a special service) experience an issue: if one session is disconnected by the user or network the remaining session also drops unexpectedly. The AMF and SMF logs for those UEs show that when one PDU session release completes; the context for the second session was also erroneously cleared.,This was determined to be a bug in how the AMF handled multiple active sessions for a single UE. The AMF was inadvertently tying the sessions together in its context management. Engineers reproduced the issue and a patch was developed to separate session contexts correctly. After applying the fix; releasing one PDU session no longer affected the other. Troubleshooting involved extensive log analysis and testing with UEs having multiple sessions to ensure the problem was resolved.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Clock synchronization issue between AMF and other nodes leading to authentication failures due to timestamp mismatches for some UEs. Some UEs fail authentication even with correct credentials; especially during certain periods. Investigation shows that the challenge-response procedure sometimes indicates a failure due to out-of-sync errors. The AMF logs and the AUSF (authentication server) logs hint at a time discrepancy in the generated authentication vectors.,It turned out that the AMF system clock was slightly out of sync (several seconds) with the AUSF and UDM. This caused the time-sensitive authentication tokens to appear expired or invalid. The resolution was to immediately resynchronize the AMF clock using NTP with the same time source as other core nodes. After synchronizing time; the authentication errors ceased. Additionally; monitoring was put in place to alert if any core network element clock drifts beyond an acceptable threshold to prevent such issues in the future.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,One SMF instance failure causing all UEs on a particular slice or DNN to lose data connectivity. The network supports multiple slices or DNNs; each potentially handled by different SMF instances. One of these SMF instances went down unexpectedly. UEs associated with that slice started losing data sessions; and new session setups for that slice failed. The AMF logs show repeated attempts to contact the specific SMF with no response; leading to timeouts for those session setups.,When the SMF instance handling that slice failed; its sessions could not be maintained. The resolution involved restarting the failed SMF and ensuring a standby SMF took over its load. The AMF configuration was also checked to verify that a backup route for session requests (to an alternate SMF) was in place. After the SMF was restored; the AMF successfully re-established sessions for the slice. To improve resilience; the procedure for automatic failover to a secondary SMF for that slice was tested and reinforced.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Network slice selection function (NSSF) misconfiguration resulting in the AMF failing to route UEs to the correct slice and some data sessions being rejected. Certain UEs are not being assigned to their requested network slice. For example; enterprise UEs requesting a dedicated slice are instead being attempted on the default slice and getting rejected due to policy. The AMF queries to the NSSF are returning errors or wrong information. This is causing slice-specific service failures.,It was determined that the NSSF had an incorrect configuration or incomplete data about available slices. The AMF was not getting proper guidance on slice selection. The fix involved correcting the slice configuration in the NSSF ‚Äì updating the mapping of S-NSSAIs to the appropriate core network endpoints. Once the NSSF was updated and the AMF was synchronized with the correct slice info; UEs were properly routed to the intended slice. The specific UEs that were failing could then establish data sessions on their slice. Additional testing was done to confirm slice selection works for all scenarios.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,gNodeB software incompatibility with NGAP updates causing one vendor gNodeB to fail registration procedures with the AMF. UEs connected to a particular vendor gNodeB are failing to register on the 5G core; while other gNodeBs (different vendor) in the network work fine. The failing scenario shows that after the UE initial message; the procedure halts. AMF logs indicate an error parsing an NGAP message from that gNodeB. The gNodeB might be using an outdated or slightly different NGAP format that the AMF latest version does not accept.,The cause was an incompatibility between the AMF NGAP implementation and the particular gNodeB software version. The AMF was expecting an Information Element that the gNodeB did not send (or formatted differently). Troubleshooting included capturing the NGAP messages and comparing them with expected formats. The resolution was two-fold: a temporary workaround on the AMF to relax the strict checking (allowing the message to be processed) and a coordination with the gNodeB vendor to update their software. Once the fix was applied; UEs on that gNodeB could register and use data services normally.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Session capacity configuration too low causing the AMF to reject new sessions after a certain number. This occurred even though resources were available. The network observed that after reaching a specific number of active sessions additional UEs trying to establish data sessions were being rejected. This limit was much lower than what the hardware could support. The AMF logs indicated it was enforcing a maximum session count and refusing new sessions once that threshold was hit treating it as if resources were exhausted.,The issue was a misconfigured parameter for maximum sessions on the AMF. It was set to a conservative number inappropriate for the deployment. Once identified; engineers updated the configuration to raise the limit to the correct level. After applying the new configuration and restarting the AMF service to pick up the changes; the artificial cap was removed. The AMF then allowed more sessions and UEs could attach and create data sessions beyond the old limit. Post-change; monitoring confirmed that the hardware was handling the increased load without issues.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Multi-PLMN support misconfigured resulting in subscribers of a second network being unable to receive service through the shared AMF. In a shared core scenario; the AMF was supposed to serve two different PLMN IDs (for two operators). Subscribers from the secondary PLMN were consistently failing to attach or get data service; whereas the primary PLMN users were fine. The failing subscribers IMSIs belong to a PLMN that the AMF did advertise support for; but something is not working in practice. The AMF is not completing the registration for those IMSIs.,The cause was a misconfiguration in the AMF multi-PLMN settings. The secondary PLMN identifiers were not fully provisioned (or a roaming agreement flag was missing). The team corrected the AMF configuration by adding the missing PLMN ID and associated parameters properly into the system. They then tested with test SIMs of that PLMN. After correction; the AMF successfully handled registrations for the second PLMN and those subscribers gained 5G data service. Documentation was updated to ensure multi-PLMN configuration steps are thoroughly followed.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF erroneously triggers UE context release causing active data sessions to drop prematurely for some UEs. It was observed that on some occasions the AMF signaled a UE Context Release toward the gNodeB without a clear reason; leading to those UEs being disconnected even though they had active sessions. This happened intermittently; often shortly after a successful registration or session setup. The UEs were forced to reattach to resume service.,Investigation revealed a software bug where the AMF incorrectly determined that certain UEs were inactive or duplicate and sent a release. The resolution required a software patch to fix the UE context management logic. The team collected logs around the events and identified the erroneous trigger condition. After applying the patch; the AMF no longer sent unexpected release messages. UEs stayed connected as expected. Additionally; monitoring was put in place to catch if any unusual release events occur in the future.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Over-aggressive periodic registration timer causing UEs to be deregistered if they do not update fast enough; this interrupted data service. Some UEs are getting deregistered by the network while they are idle. It turns out the network is expecting them to perform periodic registration updates very frequently. UEs that do not send an update within that short interval are being removed from the AMF context meaning when they try to resume the network treats them as new attaches causing a break in ongoing data sessions.,The cause was an incorrectly set periodic registration timer on the AMF (and broadcast to UEs). It was configured to a value shorter than most UEs default behavior leading to mismatches. The resolution was to adjust the timer setting to a more appropriate (longer) duration that aligns with UE expectations and standards. After updating this configuration on the AMF and gNodeBs; UEs were no longer unexpectedly deregistered during idle periods. This prevented unnecessary session interruptions.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Duplicate AMF ID in network configuration causing some UEs to attach to a wrong or conflicting AMF and leading to unstable connections. Due to a configuration oversight; two AMF instances were set with the same AMF identifier (AMF ID). This caused confusion in the network. Some UEs sometimes got handled by one AMF and then their follow-up messages got routed to the other which did not recognize them. Users experienced dropped connections or had to reattempt registration. Logs showed inconsistent assignment of UEs to AMFs and gNodeBs were unsure which AMF to target for certain UEs.,Once the duplication was discovered in the AMF IDs; the fix was to assign a unique identifier to each AMF as intended. Network configuration (both AMF and gNodeB settings) was updated to correct the IDs. After rectifying this; each UE consistently interacted with a single correct AMF instance. Stability returned to those connections. As a preventative measure; a configuration audit was implemented to flag duplicate IDs for any core network elements in the future.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Suboptimal message scheduling in AMF leading to delays in processing signals under high load. Under heavy load; it was noticed that less important management messages were being processed by the AMF while some registration messages were waiting. This led to a few UEs timing out on registration or session setup because their requests were queued behind lower priority tasks. Essentially; the AMF scheduling was not prioritizing certain NAS messages appropriately when resources were strained.,The team identified that the scheduling algorithm in the AMF did not prioritize initial attach or session setup messages over routine management tasks. A fix was applied in the form of a software update that adjusted the priority of different message types. After deploying this update; the AMF began processing registration and session establishment signals with higher priority during high load. Subsequent tests under load showed that procedures completed without undue delay and UEs no longer timed out waiting for service.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Partial network interface failure on AMF disconnecting a subset of gNodeBs and impacting UEs served by those nodes. Due to a hardware issue; one of the network interface cards (NICs) on the AMF failed. gNodeBs connected via that particular interface lost connectivity to the AMF while gNodeBs on other interfaces were unaffected. This resulted in a localized outage: UEs on the affected gNodeBs lost data service and could not register whereas other UEs continued normally.,Engineers quickly identified the interface card failure through hardware logs. The immediate action was to reroute the affected gNodeBs to a backup interface where possible. The faulty NIC was then replaced. After replacement and reconfiguration; the gNodeBs re-established their SCTP connections with the AMF. Service was restored to the impacted UEs. To avoid such issues; the AMF was configured with link redundancy so that if one interface fails traffic automatically shifts to another without interruption.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Overload control activation causing the AMF to intentionally delay or reject some UE requests to protect the system; this led to service access delays. During a period of extreme load; the AMF triggered its overload protection mechanism. This resulted in some UEs being told to wait (for example via a back-off timer in a reject message) or their non-urgent requests being temporarily rejected. While this protected the core from crashing; those UEs experienced delayed service until the load subsided. The behavior was observed in logs as overload control signals being sent.,Overload control kicking in indicated the system was running beyond its comfortable capacity. The resolution was twofold: operational and configuration. On the operational side; additional AMF capacity was brought online to share the load and the distribution of UEs was balanced. On the configuration side; threshold parameters for overload triggers were fine-tuned so that only truly necessary throttling would occur. After these steps; the AMF was able to handle the traffic without broadly delaying UE requests and the overload protection only engages in more extreme scenarios.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Emergency service attach misconfiguration preventing emergency call UEs from establishing the required data session for IMS emergency services. Emergency calls from 5G phones were not going through. When an emergency number was dialed; the phone tried to establish an emergency PDU session for IMS emergency services but it failed. The AMF logs show that the emergency registration was accepted but the subsequent setup of an emergency data session was rejected. Regular (non-emergency) services were unaffected.,Upon investigation; it was found that the AMF (and related network functions) were not configured with the proper APN (DNN) or slice for emergency services. The AMF did not know how to handle the emergency PDU session request. The fix involved configuring the network with the appropriate emergency session settings: a predefined emergency DNN and ensuring the AMF and SMF recognized emergency call requests. After updating the configuration; emergency calls established the necessary data session for IMS (VoLTE or VoNR emergency) and were completed successfully. The change was tested to ensure reliability of emergency services.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Temporary thread crash in AMF service causing some requests to fail until the thread auto-restarted; this led to intermittent service for a subset of UEs. A particular service thread within the AMF responsible for processing a certain subset of tasks (for example handling location updates or paging) was observed to crash occasionally under specific conditions. When it crashed; those specific tasks would fail or be delayed until the AMF automatically restarted the thread or process. UEs experienced issues like missing a page or having to retry a location update procedure; but the AMF as a whole did not go down.,Developers determined there was a code bug causing that thread to crash when it encountered an unusual sequence of events. The AMF had a built-in mechanism to restart the thread; which is why the impact was limited. For resolution; a patch was created to fix the bug in the thread code. In the meantime; operations put the AMF under increased monitoring to quickly react if the thread crash happened again. Once the patch was applied; the thread remained stable and UEs no longer experienced the intermittent issues. The resolution ensures that the particular sequence no longer triggers a crash.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,GUTI (temporary ID) collision issue leading to two UEs being confused for each other; one UE session was mistakenly affecting the other. In a rare case; two UEs were assigned identical 5G-GUTI (temporary identifiers) by the core due to an ID generation bug. As a result when one of those UEs tried to establish a session or update its registration the AMF overwrote the context of the other. This led to dropped connectivity for one UE and confusion in the network records. The issue was observed when logs showed an existing context being unexpectedly replaced during a new registration.,The root cause was a bug in the identifier allocation algorithm that did not properly avoid recently released IDs. The resolution was to fix the ID generation logic to ensure uniqueness even in rapid attach and detach scenarios. Engineers also manually cleared the conflicting contexts and forced both UEs to re-register to get new unique identifiers. After the fix; no further collisions occurred. The AMF was monitored for a period under high attach and detach churn to confirm the issue was resolved.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Policy control misconfiguration resulting in a certain group of subscribers being inadvertently blocked from data service. It was noticed that all users of a specific plan or category (for instance enterprise users or a specific APN) were not able to use data. They could register; but right after their session would be terminated by the network. AMF and SMF logs indicated that a policy decision was denying their session. This correlated with a recent policy update in the core.,The cause was a misconfigured policy rule in the PCF (Policy Control Function) or subscription database that flagged that subscriber group as not allowed data. The AMF and SMF were simply enforcing this incorrect policy. The fix involved correcting the policy rules in the PCF and UDM so that those subscribers are allowed the intended services. After updating the policy configuration; the AMF and SMF accepted the sessions for those users. They were then able to establish and maintain data connectivity. To ensure this does not recur; policy changes will undergo more rigorous testing including sample subscribers of each category.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Path MTU issue on N2 interface leading to larger NGAP messages being dropped and causing some session setups to fail. Certain procedures that involve larger NGAP messages (for example PDU Session Setup with many QoS rules or handover preparation messages) were failing. Traces showed that those messages never reached the AMF or were corrupted. However smaller messages were fine. This typically happened for UEs with lots of QoS parameters or when multiple PDU sessions were set up at once. The network path MTU between gNodeB and AMF was suspected.,The issue was tracked to an MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) misconfiguration on the transport network for the N2 interface. Large NGAP messages were getting fragmented and lost because the network did not handle the fragmentation properly. The resolution was to adjust the MTU settings on the relevant interfaces to ensure the N2 link could transmit large packets or allow fragmentation properly. Once the MTU was corrected; the large NGAP messages got through intact. Session setups and handovers that involve bigger messages succeeded. Post-fix testing included sending maximum size messages to verify no drops.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Routine maintenance task caused performance hitch leading to brief service slowdown as the AMF did a resource-intensive task at an inopportune time. During a busy period; the AMF suddenly experienced a spike in CPU and memory usage for a few minutes correlating with a slowdown in processing registrations and session setups. Some UEs experienced delayed responses or had to retry. It was found that a routine maintenance or backup task (like log compression or database cleanup) kicked in unexpectedly during peak hours.,The AMF was performing a maintenance function at a non-ideal time. The fix was to reschedule such tasks to off-peak hours and ensure that any on-demand heavy processes are coordinated with traffic patterns. In this case; the maintenance script schedule was adjusted. After rescheduling; subsequent busy hours did not see the performance hitch. Additionally; a one-time operation was done to clear any backlog so that future maintenance tasks would complete faster. UEs and services continued normally after the adjustment.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Authentication edge case from certain SIMs causing those UEs to take longer to attach due to an extra round of authentication. Subscribers using a particular SIM type (or operator) were taking much longer to attach. The attach would eventually succeed but only after retrying the authentication step. Logs indicated that the first authentication attempt for those SIMs returned an unexpected indication requiring a fallback procedure. This only affected a subset of UEs; others attached quickly.,This turned out to be an edge case where the AUSF and AMF had to fallback to a different authentication method for those SIMs (for example using 5G EAP-AKA fallback). The delay was because the AMF did not immediately try the alternate method. The resolution was to update the AMF authentication handling to recognize this SIM type and automatically use the appropriate method without a timeout. After the update; those UEs attached on the first attempt without delay. This improvement streamlined the process and logs confirmed that the extra retry was no longer occurring.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Internal AMF service monitoring agent crash triggering alarms but not affecting 5G data sessions for users. An internal monitoring or OAM (Operations and Maintenance) agent process within the AMF crashed. This process is responsible for reporting status and metrics to the management systems. While the crash did not impede user traffic or control plane operations; it did result in alarms and loss of visibility into the AMF status. Operations noticed the AMF stopped sending heartbeat or stats updates.,The resolution involved restarting the failed OAM agent on the AMF and applying a fix to prevent it from crashing on certain data. The team checked that no actual 5G service was impacted; this was purely an observability issue. After the agent was back; it resumed sending metrics and the alarms cleared. For a permanent fix; a patch from the vendor was applied to the OAM agent service. Meanwhile; the AMF itself had continued to handle calls so once monitoring was restored it was confirmed there were no lingering service issues.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF lacks support for new IoT device category causing those devices (like RedCap 5G UEs) to fail registration on the network. A batch of newly introduced IoT-oriented 5G devices (with reduced capability specifications) could not attach to the 5G core. Whenever these devices attempted to register; the procedure did not complete. The AMF logs show it received the initial NAS messages but then rejected them due to an unsupported capability error. Other regular 5G smartphones were unaffected highlighting that the issue was specific to this new device type.,It was determined that the AMF current software did not recognize some parameters or profiles of the new RedCap (Reduced Capability) devices. The resolution was to upgrade the AMF software to a version that supports this device category. The vendor patch enabled the AMF to handle the new capability information properly. After the upgrade; the IoT devices successfully registered and established data sessions. The deployment process now includes validating network support for any new device categories to prevent such issues.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Automatic failover to backup link ensuring continuity when the primary N2 link had a brief issue with negligible impact on service. The AMF primary N2 interface experienced a short disruption (for example; a momentary line error) but the AMF seamlessly switched to a secondary backup connection. Users did not notice any outage; though a few signaling messages had to be retransmitted. The event was logged by the system as a link failover occurrence.,This was handled by the network redundancy design. No action was needed from users. The technical team reviewed interface logs to confirm the automatic failover functioned correctly. The primary link was tested and brought back into service. Since the backup took over instantly; data service impact was negligible. The only follow-up was routine: replacing a suspect cable on the primary link as a precaution. The incident highlighted the effectiveness of having redundant paths for interfaces.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,SNMP monitoring agent stopped causing an alarm for missing heartbeats but not affecting user data traffic. Network management systems reported that the AMF became unreachable via SNMP and stopped sending performance metrics. However; all 5G services continued normally for users. It appears the SNMP agent process on the AMF crashed or hung as other management protocols like ping were fine and subscribers were unaffected.,Operators restarted the SNMP monitoring agent on the AMF which restored the heartbeat and performance metric reporting. The cause was likely a bug in the SNMP agent. To prevent recurrence; a software update for the management agent was scheduled. This incident only impacted the monitoring capability and not the 5G data services. After the fix; the alarm cleared and the AMF status was fully visible to the network monitoring system again.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Older UEs require fallback procedure causing a slight delay in their connection but ultimately succeeding without user impact. A handful of older model 5G phones took a few seconds longer to complete registration and start data services. The AMF logs show that these devices initially attempted a now-deprecated cipher suite and got a security mode reject; then fell back to a supported one and continued normally. Users with those phones did not notice anything beyond perhaps a slightly slower connection setup.,No immediate action was required as the system already handled the fallback. The observation was noted and it was determined that it was due to legacy device behavior. As a fine-tuning measure; the network might consider disallowing the unsupported option upfront by configuration so that the negotiation happens faster. However; since the fallback worked and no service was denied; this remained a compatibility note. The devices continue to connect on the second attempt seamlessly.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Optional parameter missing in gNB messages leading to benign warnings in AMF logs but no effect on data sessions. During interoperability testing; the AMF log raised warnings that an optional Information Element was not present in some NGAP messages from a gNodeB. This parameter was not and the AMF used default values in its absence. The data sessions and registration of UEs on that gNodeB were not affected; only the log contained warning entries.,The warnings were investigated and it was confirmed that the optional parameter (perhaps related to gNB configuration) was not needed for normal operation. The gNodeB was from a vendor that simply omits that IE. No change in functionality was required; however to clean up the logs and avoid confusion a software tweak on the AMF was scheduled to suppress or properly handle the missing optional parameter without warning. Service continued normally and this remained only a cosmetic issue.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Slow memory growth observed with routine maintenance preventing any impact on service. Over the span of several weeks; operators noticed that the AMF memory usage was creeping upward slowly; though no issues had occurred. The trend suggested a small memory leak in a non-part of the system. However; the AMF was regularly restarted during weekly maintenance windows which reset the memory usage each time before it became problematic. Users never experienced any fault from this.,The issue was and handled by existing maintenance procedures. Engineers did file a report with the vendor to patch the memory leak in a future update; but since the usage never approached dangerous levels between scheduled restarts there was no user impact. In the interim; they continued to monitor the memory trend. Eventually; a patch was applied during a maintenance window to plug the leak ensuring even over long runtimes the memory stayed stable.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,License server unreachable briefly triggering a grace period on the AMF but not interrupting service. For a short period; the AMF could not contact its license server or controller (network connectivity issue to the license service). The AMF raised an alert that it was operating on a grace license mode. During this grace period; all user services continued normally and users were unaware of any potential issue. The system has a built-in grace period to handle such temporary disconnects.,The situation resolved itself once the connectivity to the license server was restored. The AMF continued to function using its grace period with no degradation to user services. Administrators confirmed that the grace period was active and kept an eye on it; but since the connection came back well before the grace period lapsed no further action was necessary. They did however check the network connectivity to ensure the license server is reliably reachable in the future. The alarm about license connectivity was cleared automatically upon reconnection.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,hardware error on interface module corrected by error handling; this resulted in no noticeable service issues. One of the AMF interface modules (hardware card) reported a few correctable errors (like CRC errors on a fiber link). The system error correction mechanisms handled these; and the redundancy ensured data was resent if needed. There was no user-visible impact; though the hardware logs noted the event and raised a alarm for maintenance.,The maintenance team proactively replaced the suspect fiber transceiver after noticing an uptick in correctable errors. The AMF never lost connectivity on that interface; so sessions were unaffected. Post replacement; the error count stopped increasing. This was a precautionary fix to ensure the errors did not evolve into a issue. Service remained continuous throughout and the alarm was cleared after the hardware swap and testing.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Conflicting configuration entry resulting in a warning at startup but overridden by another setting with no service impact. When the AMF booted up after a configuration change; it logged a warning that two configuration entries overlapped or conflicted (for example duplicate entries for a parameter). The system by design chose one and ignored the other; proceeding with the effective configuration. 5G services ran normally; but the warning indicated a tidy-up was needed in the config files.,Engineers reviewed the configuration and removed the redundant entry to eliminate the warning. Since the AMF was already using the correct setting (the second entry was being ignored) there was no impact on service to begin with. This was purely a configuration cleanup. After the fix; the AMF started without any warnings. This ensured clarity in system logs and prevented any potential confusion from conflicting config entries all without any user-facing issues.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,Preemptive config fix after audit addressing a potential fault before it could affect service. During a routine audit of the AMF configuration and logs; engineers spotted a parameter that was not set according to best practices (for example a timer value or threshold that was off by a small amount). Although this had not yet led to any incidents or noticeable problems; in extreme situations it might have caused a issue. No user had been affected and the network was operating normally.,As a precaution; the team decided to correct the parameter to the recommended value. The change was applied during a maintenance window even though it was not urgent. The fix ensured that the potential issue would never surface. Since the issue was caught preemptively; there was zero user impact. The AMF continued to perform normally and the audit was marked complete with all configurations validated against best practices.
As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF overloaded causing attach failures,This issue indicates that the AMF is overloaded or at full capacity. When the AMF is handling too much signaling traffic it may start dropping requests or timing out on UE registrations. As a result some devices cannot register or attach properly to the network. To resolve this monitor the load on the AMF and its resource usage. If it is overburdened consider balancing traffic by adding another AMF instance or increasing capacity. Also ensure the configuration is optimized. Restart or scale out the AMF if needed to reduce the load.

As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF misconfigured and rejecting all registration attempts,This fault suggests a configuration error in the AMF. If the AMF is misconfigured (for example with incorrect PLMN or tracking area settings) it can reject or fail to process registration requests from UEs. The solution is to review the AMF configuration and correct any mistakes. Ensure that parameters like PLMN IDs tracking area codes and network identifiers match the rest of the network. After correcting the configuration the registration process should proceed normally.

As a 5G mobile network engineer resolve the following issues,AMF failing to authenticate subscribers,The AMF is experiencing authentication failures. This often occurs if the AMF cannot retrieve subscriber authentication data or if there is a mismatch in security credentials. It might be due to a communication issue with the UDM/AUSF or incorrect subscriber keys. To troubleshoot verify that the AMF can communicate with the UDM and AUSF. Check for any errors in retrieving subscriber profiles or authentication vectors. Ensure the subscriber credentials (like keys or SIM information) are correct and synchronized. Resolving any data mismatches or fixing network connectivity should restore proper authentication.
